            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Tranſlation therfore in generall by ſome vaine pretendants, in tongues, and languages, hath bin thought alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a thing, not only vnneceſſary, but further preiudicial, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt reaſon leading them thereunto, being this, as I ſuppoſe, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being an ornament, moſt befitting thoſe noble or honorable, who command ignorance agreeing beſt with the vulgar ſort, who be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and obey: it is therfore requiſit (ſay they) that high wiſedome, and excellent workes, ſhould be concealed from common ſight, leſt they through equall experience, and knowledge in things (according to the ordinary condition therof) puffed vp, ſhake off likewiſe that humility of ſpirit, which ſhuld comprehend them vnder the obedience of laws and magiſtrates. Neither in my opinion, for ſome arguments in bookes diſcuſſed of, doe they greatly mistake, when this their opinion ſhal be grounded vpon ſo ſound a conſideration, rather then on a vaine oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in, themſelues wherby they would willingly retaine, ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of excellencie, by reſeruing vnto themſelues in a reſtrained tongue, that which peraduenture therin they do not abſolutely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or which howſoeuer by publication, may be an occaſion of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall document, and inſtruction to al men: To leaue compariſon of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and whether ſtraungers or our ſelues haue therein attained to

            <p>In a growne ſtorme of heauy miſfortune, it was my hap, to put in with the harbour of a worthy gentlemans houſe, where amongſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie other relaxations for a diſtreſſed mind, a multitude of good, and commendable writers in the beſt languages was not the leaſt, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to peruſe theſe diſcourſes, (although of too high a tenor for my hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble fortune) partly by perſwaſion, as likewiſe, in that I could not call to mind any ſo important booke, touching theſe ſubiects in the Engliſh tongue, I attempted this homely, &amp; vnworthy interpretation of them, wherin if I haue preſumed any thing, either aboue my own conceit, or the good opinion of others, impute it to the ſpecial deſire I had, that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honorable, either by birth, or inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, might be partakers of ſo neceſſary &amp; excellent diſcuſſions, alwaies crauing pardon, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer defacement they endure, by my vnperfect and mother expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: whatſoeuer Poeſie you herein meet withal (as with ſome you ſhal) it being rather accidental, then any waies by the noble author at the firſt intended, you may the more gratiouſly winke at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects therein, as one, whom the oppreſſion of fortune hath denied that ſerenity of mind, from whence (for the moſt part) that pleaſant fury hath his deriuation, I haue therefore contended, only with bare rithming deſinence voyd of all ornament, to expreſſe the meaning of ſuch poetical citations as the author vſeth, they being ordinarily alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of Petrarch whoſe verſe in my opinion, euen in Italian, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weighty or ſententious than heroical. And therfore I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I haue ſeen ſome of the ſame verſes in this booke cited, by a good appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Laureate tranſlated into Engliſh, the which, though they retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:16643:4"/>the pith and ſubſtance, of the firſt author, yet (excepting alwaies better iudgements then my owne) they came very ſhort of that lofty and aboundant profluence, with which many of our moderne Poemes are accompanied: conſidering withal, how too labored a tranſforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of words and ſence, might haue offered my firſt author capital iniury, ſeeing he ſetteth them downe but as authorities wherein mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more then wordes is to bee required: No leſſe doubte I alſo of reprehenſion, for ſome words I haue vſed beyond common vſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety leading me therto, rather then any affectation which conſiſteth not in ſo tollerable and commendable liberty, but rather in a friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous accumulation of words vnneceſſarily produced in dilating of any argument: yet if any may lay vp in this our common treaſury of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, any choiſe ornaments, for the decorum &amp; coppy of our tongue. I know not who may better then they, conuerſant in forraine writers, ſeeing beſides a laudable emulation of others aboundance, euen very neceſſity in explication, inuiteth them thereunto: and therefore for want of better tearmes I haue bin driuen to vſe ſome forged words, as ſpiritally, vertually, armiger, and other, which otherwiſe I could not wel tel how to haue expreſſed. Another thing there is, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation wherof maketh my eares to glow, with an imaginatiue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing of ſome bitter taxation: eſpecially it conſiſting in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, whereof the leaſt expectation wil not be had: for in the meane this author ſetteth downe for reducement of quarrels to peace, he hath preſcribed a certaine forme of words, which no doubt to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will ſeeme ridiculous, as, ſauouring too much of feare, and puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, which ſeuere cenſure notwithſtanding in my iudgement, may deſerue mittigation, if not in reſpect of the daungerous abuſe of armes in theſe times: at leaſt yet in calling to minde, what in the former diſcourſes hath bin enioyned euery honorable man, vpon the inſtant of receiuing an iniury, to performe: the which once paſt, this voluntary, and kind accord, is not to ſpring from themſelues, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſome other, who ſhall offer themſelues to ſuch vertuous ſolicitations, when it wilbe requiſite (as he himſelfe ſaith) to ſo good an end, to vſe al commendable fallation, and by words of equiualent, and plauſible ſignification to couer offences, preuenting by this meanes ſo many lamentable effects, as too ordinarily enſue, vpon inueterate,
<pb facs="tcp:16643:5"/>and proſecuted quarrells: Theſe be not al, but the principalleſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (as I ſùppoſe) which detraction in this my labor wil take hold of: the which notwithſtanding curteous, and iudicial vnderſtanders will ſo gratiouſly paſſe ouer, as that ther is no doubt but for al this, they wil find themſelues wel ſatisfied by <hi>Patritio,</hi> in the explanation of true, eſſentiall, and ſenſible Beautie in Humane Loue by <hi>Guirino,</hi> in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Combate, and fighting for reputation by <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> in Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by <hi>Varano:</hi> in riches by <hi>Taſlone,</hi> and laſt of al, in that high and worthy controuerſie touching precedence of Letters or Armes, after reſolute conflict, beeween <hi>Patritio,</hi> and <hi>Brancaccio</hi> noble champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for each partie, the deepe, and iudicial doome of gratious Madam de <hi>Sala,</hi> will determine herein al ſcruple, and attribute due right, and deſert: And therefore as this worthie circumſtance of Iuſtice, ſhineth like a bright beame in euery noble, or liberall minde, ſo doe I hope alſo for my labour, to reape curteous and fauourable conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely of my own imperfections, but euen of thoſe alſo that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily depend on the error of impreſſion, &amp; if my poore battered name light into the fatal hands of malicious Impoſtors or odious ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers: <hi>di buffoni mi beffo:</hi> and as it was ſaid of that miſerable Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine: <hi>C'eſt l'enfer, que les á crées.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat moſt renowmed Lorde <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo d'Eſte,</hi> the ſecond of this name, and through our happie fortune, at this inſtant Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> liueth with ſo great magnificence, that his highnes court ſeemeth rather a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Royall Pallace, then the court of a great Duke: for it is not onely throughout repleniſhed with noble Lordes and valiant Knights, but further, is a receptacle for the moſt learned and gentle ſpirits, as likewiſe for men that in euerie profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are moſt excellent. This Prince (out of queſtion) in al his actions verie reſpectiue, tempereth ſo his affaires with leiſure, and with ſo great order meaſureth &amp; diſpenſeth the time, that neither doth he weaken himſelfe with the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdenſome meditation of matters ſerious, or languiſh and weare away with the too great leuity of things delightſome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16643:6"/>and pleaſant. And therefore his highneſſe hath allotted to euerie ſeaſon his proper and particular entertainement, as to the Carniuale time or ſhrouetide, masking, Iuſts, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey, feaſts, Comedies, muſick, and other ſuch like content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the which with ſuch peace and tranquility are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, as it is a wonder in that time to behold the generall exhilleration and Iubile of our Citie. In the Spring time they hunt the Foxe and ſlie their Faulcons in the great <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> which enuironeth the north quarter of the City, where in certaine ſtanding waters and martiſh grounds, they finde many wilde ducks, for the flight of the Riuer. And there be certaine houſes called <hi>Sgarzare,</hi> wherein Herons be enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and kept, being a moſt pleaſant ſight to beholde his highneſſe, when with his court, he entreth into that large Medow, accompanied by the nobility of the Citie, mounted on goodly horſes, and followed by the moſt excellent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, with all the Ladyes and Matrons of the nobleſt ſort, riding in moſt ſumptuous Coaches: where after they haue flowen at the riuer, they approch the <hi>Sgazare,</hi> and let flie the Heron, who no ſooner mounteth, but incontinently they caſt off the Faulcon, who maketh after: and thus with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſolace they ſtand beholding this battaile in the aire, made by theſe two moſt hot and cruell foules. Then in the ardent heate of ſummer, his highneſſe with the famous Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe and the whole court, retire themſelues to <hi>Belriguardo,</hi> being queſtionleſſe a royal Pallace, wherein are to be ſeene as manie roomes, as there be dayes in the yeare, with cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, galleries, and hals ſo great, as therein men may conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently play at ballown. There are alſo moſt beautiful gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, abounding with al manner of fruit, waterd from the Riuer of <hi>Poe,</hi> by conueyances, which by his highneſſe with wonderful art, were thither conducted, which neare the ſaid Pallace cauſe certaine mils to grinde, with a faire and ample fiſh-pond, where there is alwaies found great ſtore of fiſh: and the water in this pond being moſt cleare, it ſerueth very conueniently to ſwimme in, being as it were continually
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16643:6"/>ſhadowed by verie high popplar trees, which do enuiron it. While his highneſſe remaineth in this Pallace, he keepeth open Court, ſo that the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen of the City, are alwayes comming and going: as furthermore, al ſuch are there lodged, that come for audience, and to negotiate with his highneſſe, neare whom euer the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and ſecretaries are reſident. Here the hotteſt part of the day is paſſed ouer with delectable entertainment: when towards the euening his highneſſe with the Ducheſſe, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and Gentlemen (being a moſt excellent ſight) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to fly the Sparrehawke) killing aboundaunce of Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and Partrich, where of in thoſe fields there is ſtore and plenty. In the end of Autumne, his highneſſe, the Lady Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, and all the court, with other gentlemen and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of the City, goeth to the ſea ſide, where among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delightſome habitations, neare to Port <hi>Goro,</hi> in a parke called the <hi>Meſola,</hi> hee hath built a ſumptuous pallace, the which parke his Highnes certainly with heroical expence, hath compaſſed with a wall, which is twelue miles in circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, with foure gates, placed according to the foure quarters of the heauens, the which are kept ſhut, that the beaſts may not go out, being likewiſe to open, as occaſion requireth. Herein interchangeably they take diuers delights, ſomtime fiſhing in the ſea by draught, and otherwhiles in hunting, and at al theſe paſtimes the excellent Ducheſſe is euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with all the dames and matrons, who with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment take pleaſure in the cliaſe. For the huntſinen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their dogges into the wood, and forcibly procure the wilde beaſts to iſſue forth into certaine large open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made for the purpoſe, where there be dogges placed for the nonce, and Gentlemen, ſome on foot with long bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, others on horſe backe, with ſpeares and iauelins: and thus with notable agilitie, they kill boares, harts, and other, beaſts, ſo that we may truly ſay, that in the world there is not a Prince enioyeth more excellent chaſe, or commodious fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing then here is. Afterwards in the euening the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16643:7"/>to the pallace; while ſupper, the time is ſpent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleaſant entertainements: Wherefore his Highneſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wont, being the laſt yeere towards the end of Autumne in the ſaid place, and the moſt famous Ducheſſe, accompanied with thriſe noble Gentlemen, and gratious Dames, amongſt whome was the honourable Lady Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe of <hi>Sala,</hi> the two right illuſtrous and moſt beautifull ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the Lady <hi>D. Marfiſa,</hi> and <hi>Bradamante;</hi> the Lady <hi>Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Tieni</hi> Couoteſſe of <hi>Scandiano;</hi> the Lady <hi>Iſabella Bentiuoglia</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Galtieri;</hi> the Lady <hi>Camilla Coſtabili,</hi> the Lady <hi>Lucretia Calcagnina;</hi> the Lady <hi>Victoria Taſſona;</hi> the Lady <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla Beuelacqua;</hi> the Lady <hi>Lucretia Machiauella;</hi> the Ladie <hi>Camilla Moſti;</hi> the Lady <hi>Anne Strozza;</hi> the Lady <hi>Tarquinia Molza;</hi> the Lady <hi>Leonora Sacrati,</hi> with other Ladies and Matrons of account, beſides the Gentlewomen of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed Ducheſſe. When his Highnes deſirous to go down to the ſea ſide, to procure the nettes to be drawne, he made it knowne to the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, that while they were abroad, his minde was, that euery one might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully betake himſelfe to that contentment, which was to him moſt acceptable. Whereupon one part of the Gentlemen, the Lady <hi>D. Marfiſa</hi> and <hi>Bradamante,</hi> and other Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Court, accompanied his Highneſſe, and the Ducheſſe to the ſea ſide: but the greater part, eſpecially of women, vnto whome the ſea winde in the end of Autumne was not pleaſing, went to the Pallace, to the end that with ſome delightſome entertainement, they might paſſe the time till the returne of his Highneſſe. The Counteſſe of <hi>Sala</hi> for her quiet, had retired herſelfe into her lodging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, vnto whome all the Gentlemen and Ladies reſorted, to manifeſt vnto her their fauour and good will, as alſo to bee partakers of her moſt gratious conuerſation. The Ladie Counteſſe therefore, ſeeing ſo faire and honorable an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in her chamber, as ſhe that is the inuentrice of freſh and honeſt contentments, me thinkes ſaid ſhe ſmiling, that ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers can hardly keepe their ranckes without an head, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16643:7"/>therefore, I would aduiſe, ſo it be pleaſing to you Lords and Ladies, that by lot we chuſe out amongſt our ſelues (to auoid enuy) who ought to commaund, and that her empire may continue til the returne of his Highnes. This motion by the Counteſſe propounded, was of all the whole company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. The lotte fell to the Lady Counteſſe of <hi>Scandiano,</hi> and with great ioy ſhe was crowned with a garland of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell leaues. This vertuous Lady the Queene, peraduenture of more than one heart, conſidering that in this noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, there were the moſt learned and flouriſhing wittes of all the Court, deſirous to heare them diſcourſe of ſome matter that might be contenting, and acceptable to the whole company, ſpake thus: Amongſt all the things which adminiſter delight and wonder, it ſeemeth Beauty holdeth the chiefeſt place, the which is ſo much the more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in that ſhe by few being perfectly knowne, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by euery one beloued, which thing I with my ſelfe hauing oftentimes conſidered, it maketh me enter into a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular deſire to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what maner of thing this is, which we terme Beauty; whether truely ſhe be to be found in the world, or that we forge ſuch a matter, in our fantaſie, percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euery day, by experience, that what to one ſeemeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to another appeareth beautifull. Seeing therefore a fauourable ſtarre and gentle fortune haue exalted me to ſo great Empire, and that I may commaund ouer the diuineſt wittes, I determine to ſatisfie my honeſt deſire: I enioyne you therefore Signior <hi>Franceſco Patritio,</hi> vnder paine of the loſſe of my fauour, (the which hitherto I haue vouchſafed you) to diſcourſe vpon Beautie, endeuoring in the beſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you can to giue me ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Signior Patritio</hi> is a Gentleman of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> a man very learned, but eſpecially in Platonicall philoſophie, who hauing bene a little buffeted by Fortune, in the end retiring himſelfe into the ſanctuary of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> literate (for ſo is the court of this Prince) he was with honorable regard, by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe embraced. Riſing vp therfore, and making reuerence:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16643:8"/>This curteſie of your Maieſtie, thrice famous Queene (ſaid he) hath beene great and ſingular, hauing before any deſert on my part vouchſafed me ſo great a reward, as to bee made woorthy of your Maieſties fauour. And whatſo greeuous puniſhment can be imagined, that to the loſſe of this, may be compared; but as with ſo gratious a gift I remaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, ſo vpon ſome further conſideration, I finde my ſelfe altogether perplexed &amp; doubtfull, becauſe in obeying your commandement, I am ſure not to ſatisfie your deſire, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my owne inſufficiencie to intreate of ſo high a ſubiect, as is Beautie: and by diſobedience I ſhould incurre the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie ſet downe, the which I much more feare than death it ſelfe. To ouoyde therefore ſo greeuous puniſhment, I will make no doubt to expoſe my ſelfe to ſo great an enterpriſe, hoping, that as thoſe bleſſed intelligences, in their ſpheres, illuminations and motion, infuſe that, whereof the beautiful of-ſpring of Nature in this inferior world is deriued, ſo that theſe reſplendant intelligences which are heere placed ſo neare our hearts, reuerberating vpon me their moſt glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring beames will kindle light, and ſtirre vp motion in my obſcure and dull vnderſtanding: from whence conceits and words may ſpring, apt not only to diſcouer that participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, but euen eſſentiall and true beauty. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we (moſt famous Queene) hauing Beauty before our eies, leauing the firſt demand, pertaining onely to the blind, and ſearching out what thing this is which we call Beauty, I will affirme, that it is no other but a moſt pretious qualitie, which ſhineth in the vniuerſall frame, growing from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions or colours, or from the one and the other, together, brought foorth by the chiefe Creator, to no other end, but with wonder and delight, to kindle loue in thoſe mindes, which can comprehend it. Deſiring therefore to make knowne, that this my definition is perfect, and vnder it that all things elſe be comprehended, it is neceſſary, that diſcourſing ſomewhat more deepely, I do ſhew the proper and particular beauty of all thoſe things, which in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16643:8"/>frame of this world are of beauty capable. I ſay then, that as this great worke which we call the world, is known by ſenſe, and by vnderſtanding conceiued, ſo is it druided into two partes, the one of which we terme the ſenſible, and thother the intelligible world: the ſenſible world hath two parts one ſubiect to viciſsitudal generation and corruption, &amp; it is this world which wee enioy, being ſo deare to vs, the other is the celeſtiall world, ſubiect to no other tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely locall motion: the corruptible worlde is contriued of the foure Elements, Earth, Water, Ayre, and Fire, as likewiſe of all things mixed: whereof ſome be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and others vnperfect, and of the perfect ſome be liuing, otherſome without life: of liuing things, ſome haue onely the ſoule vegetatiue, others haue vegetation, and ſence: and and the third ſórt enioy both vegetation, ſenſe, and alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Imperfect mixtions, ſo called, becauſe they want little of being ſimple, are the vapours, whereof all thoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mixtions are generate in which moiſture beareth ſway, as deaw, froſt, miſtes, clowdes, rayne, ſnow, tempeſts, and ſuch like; and exhalation the mother of all ſuch things, in which heate and dryneſſe preuaile, as are lightnings, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, thunderbolts, windes, falling ſtarres, comets, and other like impreſsions, which are ingendred in the higheſt region of the ayre; the perfect mixtions without life, are ſtones, pretious gemmes, and mineralles: liuing things, tetaining vegetation, are plants, hearbes, and all ſortes of fruites: li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing things hauing both vegetation &amp; ſenſe, be vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, of which ſom be imperfect, others perfect; the imperfect be thoſe which haue no other ſenſe, but feeling and imagination confuſed: and therefore they liuing halfe a life, are recounted betweene plants and liuing creatures, as oyſters, muſcles, ſponges, and other ſuch like creatures, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening vnto ſtones: creatures perfect be all the other ſorte, whether they be beaſts on the earth, fiſh of the ſea, or foules of the ayre; the liuing creature poſſeſſed with a ſoule vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, ſenſible, and teaſouable is onely man. The celeſtiall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16643:9"/>world, although it be al of one ſelfe ſame ſubſtance, and that it ſeemeth at the firſt ſight one heauen alone, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by diuers motions wee learne, that it is diſtributed into ten ſpheares: the firſt of which aſcending vpwarde, is the ſpheare of the moone, the ſecond of Mercurie, the third of Venus, the fourth of the Sun, the fift of Mars, the ſixt of Iupiter, the ſeuenth of Saturne, the eight of the ſtarrie fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, the ninth and tenth, the one of which (if the poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Aſtrologers be true) giueth motion trepedatiue, and the other motion diurnall, called therefore the firſt mouer. The intelligible world is comprehended by many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers orders of bleſſed ſoules and ſpirits, the loweſt of which is mans ſoule, and after that enſueth the not erring intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, called the ſoule of the world and Nature, for the three effects, ſhe produceth in this vniuerſall frame, for in as much as ſhe giueth life &amp; preſerueth the world, ſhe is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſoule of the world, and in that ſhe imprinteth into matter with the ſeale of diuinitie, al formes generatiue and corruptible, ſhe is called nature: laſtly becauſe ſhe directeth euerie thing depriued of vnderſtanding, to their ende, ſhee is tearmed intelligence neuer erring. This is ſhe (moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Queene) that procureth the birds with ſo great indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie to build their neſts, ſhe imprinteth naturall deſire of generation in all creatures, and contemning their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per commodity, with great care and labour to bring vppe their yong. She maketh the Bee and Ant to prouide in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for the future wants of winter, and to conclude, it is ſhee that is alwaies intentiue to the good of the whole world. The Angelical ſpirits follow, being the moſt noble orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the celeſtial ſpheares, diuided into many Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies: the firſt of which wholly enflamed with diuine loue, is that of the Seraphins, the ſecond of the Cherubins, all repleniſhed with incomprehenſible knowledge, in the third be the thrones faythfull ſecretaries of the celeſtiall minde: then follow Dominations, Powers, Principalities, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Archangels: aboue whome ſitteth as perfect, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16643:9"/>firſt vnderſtanding, being the moſt excellent &amp; great God, who immouable, draweth and conioyneth all the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, as of them be loued &amp; deſired, to himſelfe. As this vniuetſall worke is diuided into two parts, the one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall and ſenſible, the other incorporeal and intelligible, ſo be there two beauties, the one ſenſible, the other intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. But in that the beginning of all our knowledge, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from ſenſe, we will firſt intreate of Beauty ſenſible: the which is no other but that moſt gratious qualitie, which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in bodies ſenſible, ſpringing from proportion or colors or together both from the one &amp; other, which adminiſtring delight, produceth loue in thoſe minds that can comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. And becauſe bodies ſenſible are of two ſortes, that is, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the heauen and foure elements be, or compounded as albodies mixed are, we muſt obſerue, that of all bodies ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Heauen onely may bee termed beautifull, for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements being incapable of proportion, light &amp; colors, they cannot properly be called beautifull. Leauing them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apart with the mixed bodies, that com not much ſhort of being elements, we will affirme, that ſenſible beauty only in heauen, and bodies perfectly compounded is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, which notwithſtanding is not all one, but as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded bodies be diuers, ſo are there beauties diſtinct and different: in that ſome are compounded of like partes as ſtones, pretious gemmes and mineralles, others of parts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and in themſelues diſſenting, as plants, and liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We wil then auerre, that both the beautie of heauen, and of compounded bodies of partes vnlike conſiſteth only in colours, for though the beautie of things compounded of partes different, conſiſteth in proportion and colours; yet of ſome the beautie confiſteth principally in colors, as likewiſe of otherſome in proportion. The beauty therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with heauen is adorned, is no other but his moſt bright end ſhining colour, which doth not onely make heauen beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, but further, is an occaſion, that al other ſenſible beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is faire and apparant. The beautie of ſtones conſiſteth in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16643:10"/>their colours, as of marble, porpherie, alabaſter, and ſuch like. That of the diamond in his white and excellent colour, like to the ſtarres, as alſo the beautie of the rubie is in his red and cleere colour. The beauty of mineralles alſo conſiſteth in colours; for gold in colour like to the Sunne, receiueth his brightneſſe; and ſiluer in whiteneſſe reſembleth the Moone, and ſo all other mettalles by their proper colours are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med faire and beautifull. Plants haue their beautie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and colours; but more ſpecially in proportion. That of hearbs and floures, conſiſteth rather in colour than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion: but the beautie of creatures irrationall, is placed principally in the proportion and correſpondencie, that the partes betweene themſelues, haue with the whole, and farre leſſe depending on colour. Mans beautie conſiſteth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and in ſplendor of his proper and well placed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: But in that I reſerue the diſcuſsion of humane Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the end of this my diſcourſe, we wil now leaue it. And that no Beautie may remaine vntouched, before we paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the Beautie of the world intelligible, we will ſpeake ſomewhat of artificiall Beautie, ſeeing things artificiall alſo are termed beautifull: and amongſt thoſe artificiall, I place Poeſie, and Speach or Oration, the one being gouerned by Arte Poeticall, the other by the Art of Rethorike. And as we find quantitie both in the one and other, ſo in them both proportion, and colours Poeticall and Rethoricall are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; yet theſe are not knowne by ſenſe, but by the minde and vnderſtanding, wherefore the beautie of Poeſie and Oration, ought to bee called an artificiall intelligible Beautie, differing from other beauties artificiall, which by the ſenſe of ſeeing onely are comprehended. The beautie therefore of things artificiall, being as it were the image of thoſe naturall, conſiſteth as well in colour as proportion; yet in ſome we conſider only proportion, as in ſtatues, buildings and other like, which proceede from manuall Artes, in which there is little reckoning made of colours. In ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things the beautie remaineth in colour; and theſe bee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16643:10"/>ſuch as depend on the Arte of Weauing, as clothes of ſilke, wooll, linnen, and ſuch like. The beauty of plants is reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted both in one and other, that is, in proportion and colors: And let this ſpoken, be ſufficient for Beautie artificiall.</p>
            <p>Now paſsing ouer to that Beautie which onely with the eyes of the ſoule is comprehended (being Beautie intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible) beginning from the loweſt, and is that which is found in the ſoule of man. I ſaye, that as the Beauty of humane bodie (as we wil ſhew) is placed principally in the ſuperiour part, which regardeth heauenly light; ſo the Beautie of mans ſoule is found in the more eminent parte of the ſame, the which is expoſed to diuine light. This is called vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which our ſoule conceiueth and knoweth, not only the being of things corporeall &amp; ſenſible, but alſo by meane of thinges viſible, raiſeth it ſelfe to the knowledge of thoſe inuiſible, ſo that as we obſerue the ſoule of man to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of parts and diuers parcells, ſo the ſame ſoule from the conſent of partes and colours, receiueth his excellencie: colours are no other but intelligible kinds, placed in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which with colours haue the like ſimilitude, as the viſible colours themſelues, and theſe may be termed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; for as colours are not actually viſible, neither can their beauty by bodily eie be ſeene, if firſt that eie, and thoſe colours, be not by ſome light, and eſpecially by the light of the firſt viſible (which is the Sunne illuminated, ſo the forms and intelligible kindes of our vnderſtanding (which is the eie of the ſoule) cannot be comprehended, if firſt that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and thoſe intelligibles, bee not by the light of ſuperior vnderſtanding cleered and illumined. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibles, which placed in vnderſtanding, do make it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect and beautifull, be of two ſortes: ſome be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibles of trueth, others intelligibles of good: thoſe of good be decking our ſoules with prudence, fortitude, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; iuſtice, make them moſt beutiful: thoſe of truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel them with two pretious habites, wiſedom &amp; ſapience, throgh which habites, our ſouls becom like to diuine beuty:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16643:11"/>proportion, by which one parte of the ſoule with admirable ſymetry anſwereth to the other, is no other but a famous ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which maketh our ſoule ſo faire &amp; beautiful, that if with bodily eyes it might be contemplated, it would produce in vs incredible loue, and wonderfull affection: this by the eie of the minde is onely diſcouered, being more excellent than a thouſand bodily eyes; and therefore in thoſe whoſe minde is not blinde, it bringeth foorth affections not onely wonderfull, but out of doubt ſuch, as neither by the tongue can be expreſſed, nor by the mind comprehended.</p>
            <p>According to order, the Beauty of the worldly ſoule fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, called Nature, and intelligence not erring, whoſe beauty in like manner is obſerued in colours and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Colours are no other, but diuine Ideaes infuſed in the ſame ſoule: and proportion is nothing elſe, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplat forme, of ſuperior vnderſtanding imprinted in the ſaid ſoule, after whoſe image by the ſeale of diuinitie, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth matter deformed, beautifull. The beauty of Angelles diuided into diuers Hierarchies, as wee haue ſaide, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but Angelicall vnderſtanding, garniſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with all formes intelligible by vnderſtanding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine. Theſe of all vnderſtandings, haue the greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receiue celeſtiall ſplendor, as thoſe who beeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſent, do face to face beholde diuine Beauty: and therefore thoſe Angelicall vnderſtandings, are alwayes in action of intelligence, and are made beautiful, after ſuche a ſort, as of deformitie they are vncapable, which is not in humane intellect, by reaſon it is not euer in action of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and is capable as well of deformitie as beauty. For when the ſoule abaſeth it ſelfe with cogitations, and intimation in the obſcuritie of ſenſible delights, the conceit of Beauty remaineth extinct and darkened; but when it is exalted to the contemplation of things ſupernall, expoſing it ſelfe to celeſtiall light, then procureth ſhee her owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue beauty, to be cleere and excellent. Hitherto (moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Queeue) we haue intreated of ſenſible and intelligible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16643:11"/>Beautie, in as much as it is Beautie participated of.</p>
            <p>Now remaineth it vnto vs to diſcourſe of true &amp; eſſential Beauty, by mean of which al things created are ſo much the more fayre, by how much the more they are partakers of it, This is found in the firſt vnderſtanding, beeing the moſt mighty and excellent God, creator and giuer of all Beauty: becauſe he alone is abſolute perfection, perfect wiſedome, and incomprehenſible Beauty: eſpecially not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by our vnderſtanding: the which at contemplation of diuine eſſence, remaineth no leſſe obfuſcate, then is the eye of a Bat in beholding the ſun. Hauing therefore to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe vpon ſo high a ſubiect, I will endeuour to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my wit and capacity, to direct your maieſtie to the contemplation of eſſentiall and true diuine Beautie, by thoſe meanes which are granted vnto vs by the Creator: For he hath not equally diſtributed his Treaſures. Angelicall vnderſtanding is repleniſhed by the chiefe creator, eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with all formes intelligible, and to it is permitted the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation of diuinity face to face. Intellect humane, in as much as it is vnited to the material body, depriued of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibles, (as a plaine &amp; ſmoothe boord) is yet in potential power to receiue all the formes &amp; intelligible repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the materiall &amp; ſenſible, by theyr own Ideas, and the immaterial and inſenſible by anothers, or in anothers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; ſimilitude: &amp; therefore al our knowledge proceedeth from ſence, things ſenſible being the true meanes which guide to the knowledge of thoſe intelligible, being as it were ſimilitudes and repreſentations of them. By theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations therefore &amp; ſimilitudes, I wil ſeeke to make known diuine &amp; true Beauty, the which conſiſteth, though in a moſt ſupereminent manner, in colour &amp; proportion, for it is a thing moſt certaine, that this ſenſible light is no other but a bright colour, colour being likewiſe nothing els, but a ſhadowed &amp; obfuſcate light, ſeeing it is generate, not only by the mixtion of the firſt qualities, but alſo by light and ſhado: wthere is this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the ſhadowie light is not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16643:12"/>of it ſelfe in viſible act, but to that is procured by bright co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, wheras bright colour is not only of it ſelf, alwaies invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible act; but further, is an occaſion that al other things be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſeene, &amp; by al mens eyes beheld. And therefore the ſun adorned with this bright colour, is the firſt viſible, the firſt ſeene, and firſt ſeeing, deſeruedly called by <hi>Heraclytus</hi> the eie of the world.</p>
            <p>This bright ſenſible colour, which is the ſunnes beauty, eaſily guideth to the knowledge of brighteſt colour intelligible, which is the Beautie of the firſt vnderſtanding, being as it were the Image and ſimilitude of it: for as ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble colours can neither bee viſible nor ſeene, without the moſt bright colour of the ſun, ſo intelligible colours, which be thoſe intelligible forms, cannot haue actual intelligence, nor be conceiued, without the preſence of moſt bright color diuine: And as the eies ſhould not be actually ſeeing without celeſtial light, ſo Intellects, which be no other but incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real eyes, ſhould not actually be intelligent without diuine ſplendor &amp; brightnes: for as the light of the ſun is of it ſelfe viſible, &amp; by it ſelfe ſeene, ſo the moſt bright colour diuine is of it ſelfe intelligibile, and by it ſelfe vnderſtood. And as the ſun by his moſt bright color is the firſt viſible, firſt ſeen, and firſt ſeeing, ſo the firſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, which is god, moſt mighty and excellent, with his moſt glittering ſhining co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and light eſſentiall, is the firſt intelligible, firſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, and firſt intelligent. The Sunne by his reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant light, exceedeth all the celeſtiall bodies in Beauty: the firſt intellect (excepting alwayes, if it bee lawfull to make compariſon, betweene the finite and infinite) through his diuine ſplendor, and moſt glittering light is in the intelligible world, of al intellects the beautifulleſt, and moſt ſupereminent: and as the light of our material fire, in theſe inferiour parts, repreſenteth the Sunne; ſo is the light of the ſunne in the worlde celeſtiall, the true ſimilitude of diuine light and brightneſſe. And therefore the diuine Philoſopher, defineth light to be no other then an influence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16643:12"/>of diuine eſſence, into al worldly things infuſed, not being any thing throughout the vniuerſall woorke, wherein ſome ſhadow of light doth not appeare and ſhine. Theſe be the meanes and ſimilitudes (renowmed Queen) which ſhew that the Beautie of the firſt Intellect conſiſteth in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per colour, being the ſame light which beautifieth, and is diffuſed throughout the whole world. It remaineth that I procure you to vnderſtand the other part of diuine and eſſentiall beauty, which is proportion. Yet let not your highneſſe imagine, that theſe beauties which I place in God, be in themſelues diuers, as alſo diſtinct, from diuine eſſence, as wee ſee in other vnderſtandings. For in God there is nothing which is not diuinity of it ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in God Idea, light, wiſedome, iuſtice, be no other but God himſelfe; notwithſtanding they are diuers by our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect manner of vnderſtanding: becauſe therfore we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand proportion as diuers from his light, we will ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it. Proportion then, which is in God parte of his Beauty, is no other but the Idea and exemplar forme of the whole world, in that diuine intellect, in which vniuerſall frame, al the parts being togither, within themſelues whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſpondent, they are in that diuine vnderſtanding with greater proportion then in the world. As in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects vnderſtanding, the modell and exemplar forme of buylding is much more fayre and excellent, then in the buylding it ſelfe: In that the forme of Building may receiue impediment from matter which euer reſiſteth I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deall reaſon, but that which is in the Soule being pure and Immateriall, can haue no defect. So that as the Beautie of the buylding and of al the parts thereof, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the exemplar forme, which in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Architect, and therefore this in the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is called Beautie participated of, and that in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects vnderſtanding, Beautie eſſentiall.</p>
            <p>So the Beauty of this worldly Frame, and al the parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of dependeth on Ideal form, in minde diuine comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16643:13"/>and therefore that is teaimed Beautie participated of: and this in the minde of the diuine Architect, is true and eſſentiall beauty, which conſiſteth as I haue ſayd, in Ideall proportion, and his ſhining light, which is not onely the true light, that illuminateth man comming into this world, but further, is that which cauſeth the vniuerſall frame to be reſplendant and beautifull. The diuine Prophet ſheweth (and it is true) that God hauing created in fiue dayes all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which are comprehended in the whole world, he finiſhed his labour the ſixt day in the worke of man. I hauing therefore dilated of the whole world in the firſt part of my diſcourſe, as alſo of al the parcels thereof, and in the ſecond of corporeal Beauty ſenſible: in the third of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial beauty: in the fourth of the Beauty of Intellects, and in the fift of eſſentiall Beauty diuine, immitation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſedome, I determine in this ſixt and laſt part, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the Beauty of the ſhape humane. Throughout the whole world diuine Beauty obſcureth al other pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The Sun exceedeth in beauty al bodyes celeſtiall, and Beauty humane excelleth all the other of this inferiour world, and therefore we may ſay with the holy ſcripture, that God created man after his owne Image, ſeeing that in man the beame of diuinity doth appeare and ſhine. This heauenly creature whome we call man, was compounded of ſoule and body, the which body, hauing to be the harbour of a moſt fayre and immortall ſoule, was created without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of hide, briſtles, feathers, skales, brutiſh tusks, or hornes, neyther with bil, or clawing talents, but moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, with his eyes towards heauen, and was placed in the midſt of the world, to the end that as in an ample Theater, hee might behold and contemplate the workes of the great God, and the Beauty of the whole world: as alſo there was granted vnto him a perfect tongue &amp; ſpeech, that enflamed with loue diuine, and repleniſhed with admiration, he might praiſe, and with words extoll diuine beauty. In humane body we find proportion &amp; colours, more then in all other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16643:13"/>bodies compounded of parts vnlike, becauſe in it that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is comprehended, which repreſenteth the whole corporeal ſenſible world, as alſo the colours that beautifie this ſenſible world; the one of which is white, like to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly light, and the other is red, like to the ſhining colour of material and viſible fire: and therefore man was worthily called a little world, ſeeing the body of man is no other but a little modell of the ſenſible world, and his ſoule an Image of the world intelligible. The beauty therefore of humane body, conſiſteth in due meaſure of proportion, that is, in fayre and goodly lineaments, and in colours wel diſpoſed: and further, which falleth not out in any other body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of parts vnlike, his beauty principally is diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in one part alone: &amp; this is in the ſuperiour part, which regardeth towards the light of the Sunne: whoſe beautie is that, which by meane of the eye procureth Loue. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (which likewiſe in no other kind of creature is founde) Beautie humane is in women, in farre greater excellencie obſerued, then in men, which was thus diſpenſed with great prouidence by the cheefe creator. For hauing graunted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vnto man for a companion, he endowed her with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beautie, for production of Man, and to enflame in him a deſire to generate that fayre and beautifull. This <hi>Anacreon</hi> confirmeth, ſaying, that as running is the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an horſe, and wiſedome of a man; ſo beautie is the proper honour of a woman: And the Philoſopher in the firſt of his Rhetroyke, doth in ſuch ſort appropriate beauty to a woman, as he ſetteth it downe principally amongſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine vertues, ſaying, that the vertues of a woman be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, honeſtie, and deſire to take paines, without auarice. And in the ſame booke ſpeaking of the beautie of man, he placeth in the viſage of man, togither with the aſpect, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, regard and countenance, to the ende that, prouoked in fighting, he might be a terror to his enemies, which doth clearely manifeſt that beautie is not in man in ſo great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as in a woman, becauſe his beautie, procureth as wel
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16643:14"/>terror as loue, wheras Beauty in women doth alwaies gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate loue, &amp; neuer procureth feare. If I were willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the beauty of viſage humane, I might much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily poynt it out with my finger, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expreſſe it by my tong. Yet for al this I wil not forbeare to affirme that to form per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Beauty in humane viſage, foure things ſitly concur, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable feature, color wel diſpoſed fauor &amp; preſence: to goodly feature &amp; color, faire &amp; comly preſence addeth ſuch excellencie, as without it al other Beauties languiſh &amp; weare away. This was wel known and commended by <hi>Petrarch</hi> in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance of his <hi>Lauretta,</hi> in the ſonnet that beginneth;
<q>
                  <l>From time to time ſhe ſeemeth more to mollifie,</l>
                  <l>By hue Angelical and her ſweete ſimpring ſmiles,</l>
                  <l>And by the fauour that her face doth dignifie,</l>
                  <l>With rolling eyes alſo, diſciphring wanton wiles.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this be a beame of the ſoule, which glittereth in the countenance after the ſame ſort as the beames of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, ſhine in their proper heauens &amp; ſpheares, or that it be an harmony of ſhadowed colours &amp; lineaments, I dare not affirme, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe my ſelf to be ignorant, &amp; wil remain bound to him, that ſhal make me capable here of. How much fauor importeth to the perfection of beauty humane, from hence we eaſily conceiue: for without fauor, beauty would neither be gracious, nor accepted of: for ſhe acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with fauor, hath force to draw to hir ſelf, al thoſe minds which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comprehend her; &amp; without fauor beauty may be ſayd to be vnperfect: therfore the ancients fained the Graces to be the waiting maids of <hi>Venus;</hi> by this inferring, that beauty ought euer to be accompanied by fauor, &amp; from hir neuer to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. Preſence principally is diſcouered in the ſweet and comly motions of the body, for the body ſtanding immoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is not apparant, and for my part I would ſay that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is no other then a certaine faculty and agilitie, which the body hath to obey the ſoule.</p>
            <p>It remaineth vnto me (moſt excellent Queen) for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this my diſcourſe, that I declare vnto your highneſſe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16643:14"/>that humane beuty to on other end, hath by the chiefe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor bin produced, amongſt al beuties ſenſible, moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but to kindle this honeſt &amp; holy loue diuine, which vniteth humane creature with his creator. For ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wholly aſtoniſhed in beholding humane Beauty, raiſeth vp his mind to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Beauty true &amp; eſſential, whereof this is a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and ſimilitude. this diſcourſe of <hi>Patritio</hi> was by the Queen commended, as alſo by the other Ladies, when <hi>S. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oan Battiſta Guirini,</hi> a gentleman moſt iudiciall in choyce and excellent learning, added. Queſtionleſſe <hi>Signior Franceſco</hi> hath ſo plentifully diſcourſed of Beauty, that little more may be adioyned thereunto; notwithſtanding, in euery part I am not ſatiffied, if he looſe not ſome doubts which holde bound my mind. For he hauing ſhewed, that Beauty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in proportion or colours, or in one and the other togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath from this his beauty excluded ſome things, which are eſteemed faire; into which being altogither ſimple, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion cannot fall, it being no other but that ſymetrie and commeſeration which the partes haue betweene themſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable togither to the whole: for we ſay, a beautiful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, a faire light, a faire voyce, a faire ſound, &amp; ſuch like: our Italian word <hi>Bello</hi> being vſed in commending of al theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, &amp; in theſe there is neither proportion nor colors. But further, he auerring that the beauty of bodies compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of parts vnlike, is the proportion that the parts haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelues, &amp; with the whole, he manifeſtly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth his friend <hi>Plotinus,</hi> principal of the <hi>Platonicall</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, who maketh plaine demonſtration, that beauty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in proportion: and amongſt many other arguments, this, in my iudgement, is not of little importance, for ſayth hee, if proportion were beautie, it would follow, that the partes which compounde the whole, ſhould not bee beautifull; for no compoſition being in them, there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no proportion, and they not being faire, how can the whole bee beautifull, conſidering that of parts not beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, an whole Beauty cannot be compounded: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16643:15"/>the conſequent is falſe; for the parts which compound the whole, are &amp; be termed faire, we vſually ſaying, a fayre hand, a faire foot, a faire eie, a beautiful noſe, &amp; ſuch like; this word <hi>Bello</hi> ſeruing for to commend al theſe perfections: the antecedent therfore is falſe, which is, that proportion is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Furthermore, he alſo vnmindful of his <hi>Plautinus,</hi> hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreated of that ſenſible beauty, which is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of the ſence of ſeeing, &amp; hath not placed that in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Beauties, which is the obiect of hearing, that being of ſo great price, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> maketh it, like to the beautie of the ſoule: and this is melody or muſick which ſo greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth, there being no doubt but that alſo is tearmed by the title of ſayre, we ſaying for the moſt part, excellent mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ſingular harmony, &amp; pleaſant conſent. I expect therfore <hi>Signior Franceſco,</hi> that you reſoluing theſe my doubts, doe cauſe your beautie to appeare, much more reſplendant and glorious, then that altogither beautifull.</p>
            <p>Very wittily and learnedly ſayd <hi>Patritio,</hi> according to the cuſtome of his pregnant wit, doubteth <hi>Signior Guicini</hi> how I haue for born to put in the number of things beautiful, ſome other which alſo are called by the ſame name, as alſo moued by the authority of <hi>Plotynus,</hi> he doubteth that proportion is not the beauty of bodies compounded of parts different, as more ouer, me lody is to be numbred amongſt beauties ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I anſwering therfore to his firſt doubt ſaid, that beauty is a quality as we haue affirmed, &amp; therfore cannot of it ſelfe conſiſt, but is neceſſary that it be reſident to a ſubiect, &amp; this ſhalbe ſubſtance. For ſubſtance as the ſound thereof impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, is that which by it ſelfe ſubſiſteth, and not the quality or accident. Colour therfore being an accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which cannot ſtand by it ſelf, it cannot be the ſubiect of beauty, but rather the beauty of the ſubiect. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeaking properly, this propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil not be true, that color is beautiful, except we vnderſtand it in this ſort, that it maketh another thing beautifull. As phiſicke is ſayde to bee healthfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it healeth another, it is alſo vnproperly ſpoken
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16643:15"/>when wee ſay, a ſayre voyce, or a faire ſounde: for beſides that there can be no ſenſible beauty: but that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the ſenſe of ſight, ſound and voyce, hath in a certayne maner the ſayd proportion with Muſicall conſent as hath the colour, with the body coloured: for as by colour, beauty is repreſented to the eies: ſo by ſound and harmony, the voyce repreſenteth melodie to the eares: whereupon as we cannot ſay a beautiful color, ſo can we not likewiſe terme the voyce to be faire, I ſay ſpeaking properly: but inſteede heereof, wee might better terme, a melodious, or good voyce, and a good or ſweete ſound. I haue not in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner placed in the number of things beautiful thoſe which be the obiects of hearing; for onely proportion in bodies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Platoes</hi> minde, is called Beauty: and in number it is termed harmony in humors health, and in the minde vertue. For as it would be no proper but tranſlated ſpeach to ſay inſteede of, beauty of the body, harmony of the body, and for the health, the beauty of the humors, ſo would it be improper to ſay, the beuty of number, or health of number, in that the ſcience it ſelfe, which intreateth of Muſicke, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his proper ſubiect, number harmonious, and not beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. That harmonie, which is the obiect that moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth hearing, is not properly beauty, as that of bodies, it is by this manifeſt; for beautie of bodies is abſolutely a work of Nature, ſhining of it ſelf, without the help or adoperation of Art: But harmonie is not wholy a worke of Nature, but dependeth of ſcience, and art humane, which the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding retaineth, by muſicall habite; and therefore in Muſike it ſeemeth, that not onely ſenſe, but alſo vnderſtanding is wakened and delighted. Further, beautie in bodies, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in action, neither needeth it humane art to be ſeene, but ſodainly at the apparance of light doth diſcouer it ſelfe; harmony, notwithſtanding it be alwaies potentially in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, neuertheleſſe without humane Art, it cannot be in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor be heard: Yet this (and with <hi>Plotynus</hi> leaue be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) is much different from beautie, by the argument of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16643:16"/>
               <hi>Plotynus</hi> himſelfe, which is, that proportion in bodies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, of partes vnlike, cannot be Beautie. For though I eſteeme him as Prince and chiefe of all the Platoniſts, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, deſiring to haue trueth my friend, I can not in this conforme my ſelfe to his opinion: For hee conſidered not, that the different partes which compound the whole, are alſo framed themſelues, of partes and parcelles vnlike: For the hand is compounded of fingers, and the fingers of ioynts and nayles, and in it doe we behold well diſpoſed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and due proportion, as likewiſe in the feete and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther members, in which out of doubt, we finde proportion of the parts and whole: and therfore when we call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, we reſpect them not as parts, but alſo as entire wholes, &amp; compounded. I further affirm, that as of matter &amp; forme, the body heauy, and light, is compounded, although neither the matter not forme, is either heauy, or light; ſo will it bee no ſuch great inconuenience, that of partes not faire, an entire beautiful ſhould be compounded. <hi>Guirini</hi> ſeemed to be ſatisfied with the anſwer of <hi>Patritio,</hi> who now withdrew himſelf, to giue place to the L. <hi>Laura Peuerara,</hi> that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Queene, had taken the Harpe into her hand for muſike: When the ladie <hi>Tarquinia Molza:</hi> go not away ſaid ſhe, Signior <hi>Patritio,</hi> for I haue alſo a doubt to caſt, neither do I thinke that the Queenes mind is, I ſhould here reſt diſcontented, as I muſt needes, you not ſatisfying me, in my own I cannot ſay, but euen in the generall doubt of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one: for who is there, eſpecially among vs women, which knoweth the reaſon (ſpeaking of beautie humane) why ſhee with vs is ſo rare, &amp; deformitie ſo frequent, and yet the quite contrary ſhuld be, if that were true which you haue ſpoken: That Nature the miniſtreſſe of diuine prouidence, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of al formes, doth imprint them in matter, according to example, in vnderſtanding diuine: how can it therefore be, Signior <hi>Patritio,</hi> that Nature, who hath euer before her eies, the true modell of Beautie, after the Image whereof ſhe intendeth to form the thing beutiful, like an vnskilful Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Grauer, ſhould for the moſt part impart deformitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:16643:16"/>This doubt Lady, anſwered <hi>Patritio,</hi> is not ſmally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting: being vndoubtedly worthie of your moſt noble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, notwithſtanding I wil endeuor my ſelfe herein, to giue you ſatisfaction. It is a thing certaine, that Beautie procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from forme, and deformitie from matter; the which, as it is of his owne proper nature vnformall, ſo al deformitie hath from it deriuation: For matter reſiſteth Ideall reaſon, ſo that in her ſhe cannot produce the perfect forme ſhee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth: and from hence commeth it, that the Grauer can neuer ſet forth Beautie in Marble, anſwerable to the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall impreſsion of her in his minde: for the marble makes reſiſtance to his chizel, hand and art. Applying this then to our purpoſe I ſay, that the matter whereof humane creature is formed (and it is pure bloud, mixed with mans ſeede, in the wombe of the woman) in which the great mother Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture determineth to introduce the Image of diuinitie, is not alwayes one, and the ſelfe ſame, but ſometimes by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, otherwhiles by the father, and often by the variabilitie of celeſtiall influence, we find it diuerſly diſpoſed. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it appeares, that one more, another leſſe, reſiſteth Ideall reaſon. By how much therfore matter is of greater reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by ſo much the more looſeth forme his beutie; as on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it obtaineth the more, the leſſe it maketh reſiſtance: And therfore diuine <hi>Plotinus</hi> defineth Beuty to be no other, but the floure of forme ſubduing matter. It ſeemes you, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the L. <hi>Tarquinia,</hi> would charge the heauens, with beautie or deformitie, ſeeing it is they that diſpoſe matter, to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſe refictance. Without doubt, anſwered <hi>Patritio,</hi> as of the cauſe inſtrumentall, the beauty and deformitie of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall influence dependeth; ſo likewiſe doth all other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this inferior world: for celeſtiall heat, is the principal inſtrument of nature, as alſo vitall heate, is the inſtrument of nature in mans procreation, which by the father in feede impreſſed, hath proportion with the ſtarry element: and therefore if nature would introduce like forme, vnto Ideall beautie, it is neceſſary, many things ſhould agree to ſubdue
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16643:17"/>the reſiſtance of matter: as theſe poynts would be requiſite, that the fathers ſeede be well diſpoſed, that the heate of the womb be temperate, as alſo that celeſtial heate be gratiouſly infuſed by the fauourable ſtarres: As <hi>Petrarch</hi> affirmeth, ſpeaking of his faire <hi>Laura,</hi> in the Song</p>

            <p>And as further foloweth: being therefore neceſſary, that ſo many things ſhould concurre together for generation of Beautie, no maruell (moſt gentle Lady,) though Beautie ſo ſeldome, and Deformitie ſo often manifeſteth her ſelfe: The cauſe of Beautie and Deformitie ſet downe by <hi>Patritio,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very probable to the Lady <hi>Tarquinia,</hi> and when all the attendants and ſtanders by, imagining, that in the like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no other thing was to be ſought after. The excellent Ducheſſe, a princeſſe of rare and ſtrange capacitie, making <hi>Patritio</hi> once againe to ſtay. You haue yet further, ſaid ſhe, to ſatisfie my doubt, which proceedes from hauing by you bin affirmed, that the beautie of humane body conſiſteth in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16643:17"/>proportion and colours: I deſire therefore to know which holdeth the chiefeſt place, becauſe by this meanes I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo come to knowledge, which is the greater defect in beuty, either diſproportion, or deficiencie in colours. Reaſon, ſaid <hi>Patritio,</hi> perſwadeth me moſt noble Lady, to yeeld the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt place to proportion, notwithſtanding ſenſe maketh me ſtand doubtfull, euer obſeruing, that the countenaunces of theſe faire Ladies, and of all women, do more ſhine and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through the aboundance of colours, than by great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Although I, if it ſo pleaſe your Maieſtie, will diſcuſſe this probleme, by allegation of reaſons, both for the one and other part: and without giuing definitiue ſentence, will leaue ſufficient armes to euery one, to defend that beſt pleaſeth him. And there is no doubt, but raſtes bee diuerſe; whereupon euery one enamoured will commend that parte in which his beloued is more excellent: for this may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in <hi>Petrarch,</hi> who ſufficiently praiſeth the colours of his <hi>Lauretta,</hi> becauſe her colours exceeded farre her propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He called therefore her faire haire, treſſes of gold, her forehead more beautifull than the heauen, he compared the eye liddes to ebonie, the cheeks to froſts, ſnowes, and roſes; the lippes to rubies, the teeth to pearles, as wee reade in all thoſe Sonets which contain the beuty of <hi>Laura:</hi> where we ſee not ſo much as one word, hauing relation to feature or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. The maner of handling this controuerſie pleaſeth me well, replied the L. Ducheſſe, ſeeing euery one may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to their owne minde: yet giue you the onſet, and begin firſt from proportion, the which out of doubt naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds colors, as do the clements things mixed. When <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> therfore, had alitle pawſed with himſelf, he ſaid: Among al beuties ſenſible, that ſeems the moſt perfect beuty, which is neerer to beauty intelligible, as alſo of that moſt participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſuch: therfore amongſt all beuties ſenſible ſhee is the greater: and conſequently where ſhe is found, is that, which to beauty, giueth greater perfection. Proportion queſtionleſſe hath greater ſimilitude wyth intelligible beautie, becauſe it can not bee proportion without order,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16643:18"/>and order is proper to reaſon, which reaſon is no other, but a ſimilitude of beautie intelligible, and of the ſelfe diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect: but further it is the more principall parte of beautie ſenſible, which reacheth delight, not onely to ſenſe, but alſo to the minde, and ſuch proportion: for by the order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of parts, the footeſteps of reaſon do in hir appeere, and therefore ſhee is very conformable to the nature of the minde, being apt to delight, and rauiſh it with vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contentment: Further, proportion is the principal cauſe of beuty, throughout the vniuerſal frame, aſwel of the world corporeal and ſenſible, as of the intelligible: conſidering that by proportion, it is created, and by the ſame preſerued; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it deſerueth the chiefeſt place in the beauty of humane body, which is no other but a model of the great world. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we ſhould fooliſhly beleene, that the worlde was made by chance, we muſt neceſſarily conceiue, that with ſpeciall prouidence, it was built by the diuine architect, as alſo it is neceſſary to place in the ſame diuine mind, the Ideal forme, as we haue ſaid of the world, by others termed the worldes Archtype, euen as it is neceſſary that the model and Idea of the building, ſhould be in the minde of the Architect. Now the principal and moſt perfect part, as well in the minde of diuine, as humane Architect is proportion, becauſe in it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſpoſition are comprehended. According to this Ideall proportion therefore was the whole worlde by God created, and firſt of figure circular; becauſe to containe this vniuerſall worke, that of al other figures was moſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, and the heauenly ſpheares were with ſo great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion framed, as likewiſe to euery one, motion, with ſo ſingular proportion diſpenſed, that in moouing (as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Philoſopher affirmeth) they procure celeſtiall harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: euery ſtarre hath his proportion to receiue light from the Sunne; and the Sunne proportionably to euery one of them, diſpenſeth &amp; infuſeth of his light; and both the ſtars, and Sunne, with ſo great meaſure and proportion, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe their light and heate into theſe inferiour bodies, as with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16643:18"/>maruel, and wonder from them, ſpringeth the beutie of this inferior world. Such proportion we finde in the elements, as well in quantitie as qualitie, as if of this their proportion, the leaſt part were but diſproportioned, one element would conuert al the other into his proper Nature, or els the world would be confounded into Chaos. Proportion cauſeth har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in number, in bodies beautie, in humours health, in minde vertue, as contrariwiſe diſproportion, procureth in numbers diſcord, in bodies deformitie, in humors infirmity, and in the minde vice: But who is it that wil doubt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the cauſe of all delights, as well ſenſible, as inte li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, in that the good which delighteth, is no good, if it bring not with it proportion, neither is there any thing that deſireth to be vnited with good ſimply, but with a good to it ſelfe proportioned; and from hence proceedeth the ſaying of <hi>Heraclytus,</hi> that euery thing is rauiſhed with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, the which ſtandes in vnion of good, to it ſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned: and this is that which properly of all things is beloued and deſired.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as there can not bee good in the vniuerſall world, without proportion, ſo can ther not in the litle world which is man, be any beauty without proportion: and, as good can not without proportion procure deſire; ſo can not beautie without proportion cauſe loue: In that loue is not generate in the louer, but by ſymetrie, which the thing belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hath with the louer: by al theſe, and other reaſons, which might be produced, we may conclude, that all perfection ſpringeth principally from proportion: and therefore that it in humane body is a part more excelent, than is the beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of colours. Me thinkes ſaide the Ducheſſe, the doubt is after ſuch a manner cleered, as wee neede not proceede any further, and that the palme is due rather to beautifull fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than to faire and well diſpoſed colours. It is a thing iuſt and requiſite, renowmed Lady, ſayd <hi>Patritio,</hi> before iudgement to attend the partie, for his allegations are not to be contemned, and therfore that louer who is made a ſeruant
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16643:19"/>to beautiful treſſes, to black eyes, to coloured cheekes, to ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie lips, to a white hand, wil alleage in defence of colors, that the beautie which is part, or rather proper offpring of the moſt perfect of all beauties ſenſible, ought to bee the ſelfe ſame, which bringeth principally the name of beautifull to that ſubiect wherin it is found; but colours are ſuch, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by colours humane body ſhall principally bee called beautifull: that colours be ſuch, it is a thing manifeſt: for light is the greateſt of all beauties ſenſible, as that which is no other but a beame &amp; influence of diuine eſſence, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer the wole world (as I haue ſaid) this being graunted to the moſt perfect, of all bodies ſenſible, which is the ſun, to the end that by it, it might not only be beautifulleſt of all other creatures, but that it ſhould alſo bee the meane and principal cauſe, of the apparance of all other beauties: co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are ſo conioyned with light, and light with colours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a ſort vnited, as we terme light a bright color in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy illumined, &amp; color a ſhadowed light in a colored body: in no poynt differing, but that light is a colour without adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, &amp; color a light ſhadowed, whereupon thoſe colors which haue leaſt adumbration, as is white, haue the greater ſimilitude with the purity of light: Light then beeing the greateſt beauty of the world, and colors part of light, and of light created, in al reaſon they ought to obtaine the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt place in humane beauty.</p>
            <p>This louer wil further argue, if the proper obiect delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ſight, is no other but beauty, colours being more delightſome then proportion or figure, ſhould alſo haue in them greater beautie. That colours be ſuch, it is proued, for colours are proper ſenſibles of the ſight, but figure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion ſenſibles common: &amp; by the opinion as wel of the Perepatetikes, as Academikes, proper ſenſibles doo more moue &amp; delight ſence, then common. Neither want there philoſophers of authority, as was moſt learned <hi>Pſellus,</hi> which hold opinion, that common ſenſibles are rather knowne by reaſon, ſtiried vp by the ſenſes, then by the ſenſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:16643:19"/>To conclude, he will thus reaſon, grounding himſelf vpon that propoſition, which runneth currant through all vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and is this: that which is the cauſe that another thing is ſuch, is much more the like it ſelf: as for example ſake: If fire be the cauſe that all other things are hot, then ſhall it of all other things be the hotteſt: I will therefore affirme, that if beautie of colours, is a cauſe that the beautie of figure and proportion is apparant, then muſt they likewiſe needes bee of more apparant beautie: as light is of all other beauties the faireſt, in that light is the cauſe of the apparance of all beauties ſenſible: and there is no doubt, but colours are the cauſe of the apparance of proportion, conſidering that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſibles cannot be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended, but by ſenſibles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: by the teſtimony of women the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, of whom beauty is the proper ornament: the ſaid reaſons may be confirmed, they being priuie, that colours in beauty humane holdeth the cheefeſt place, and are of themſelues apt to produce Loue: they imploy all their induſtrie in the beautie of colours, by making their haire like the ſhining colour of gold, the cheekes like to white lillies and red roſes, the lips to rubies, the teeth to the orient whitenes of pearle, with which beuties ſhadowing ſome other of their diſproportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they yet appeare, &amp; are called faire, kindling notwitſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by ſuch hart, in the harts of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amarous flames. Ile further adde the authority of the doctors, of the Moyſaical law, who deſirous that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leauing their beſtial appetites, ſhuld be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored of women, ſet down by publike decree, that it ſhuld be lawful for women to paint their faces, and that fathers to daughters, brothers to ſiſters, &amp; husbands to wiues, ſhuld be enioyned to allow money for the buying of colours: theſe wiſemen conceiuing, that there is not a beuty more preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to imprint loue in humane breaſts, then that of colors: &amp; thus wil this intangled louer with the beutie of colors co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that colors are the moſt principal poynts of humane beauty. Heere <hi>Patritio</hi> held his peace, and on a ſodaine great murmuring did ariſe, one defending one parte,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16643:20"/>and others another, which the Queene obſeruing, ſhe poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lady <hi>Laura Peuerara.</hi> This is a Gentleman belonging to the Ducheſſe, borne in <hi>Mantua,</hi> to the glorie of that City, married to Count <hi>Hanibal Turcho,</hi> one of the principalleſt Gentlemen of our Citie: who, as ſhe doth eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her beautie kindle loue in any one that beholdeth her, ſo with her honeſt cuſtomes and modeſtie, ſhe doth ſo aſſwage others flames, that al amarous affection, is reſolued into ſingular and ſpecial reuerence, whereupon by all thoſe that know her, ſhe is no leſſe reuerenced then beloued. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come therefore before the Queene with her Harpe, ſhe ſung ſo ſweetly, as it ſeemed the ſoule at the ſound of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine harmony rauiſhed, would haue flowne out from the body of euery one that heard her: when muſicke being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the Lady Ducheſſe dwarfe came running, and made it knowne that the Court was at hand: whereupon the queen riſing vp, the Ladies and knights after order giuen for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of theſe diſſcuſsions begun, the day following went to meete his highnes, and the reſt of the day while ſupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, was paſſed ouer in diuers recreations, and pleaſant ſports.

The which hauing well conſidered, I thinke it not much from the purpoſe, to proſequute the method &amp; begun, giue ſome occaſion to theſe pregnant and learned wits, to extend
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16643:21"/>forth ſuch like delights, which alſo vnto vs may be a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefit and commoditie: For what greater pleaſure may be taſted, then to ſatisfie that naturall deſire we haue to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. <hi>Signior Patritio</hi> ſayd yeſterday, that beautie was the mother of loue, and therefore, as of the mother I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of doubt, ſo am I deſirous to haue ſome notiſe of the ſonne, and in effect to knowe, what thing this is which wee tearme loue: for in the deſcription that <hi>Plutarch</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maketh, I am but little ſatisfied: it ſeeming vnto mee a meere fable to ſay, that he is a blind boye, winged, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, with a bow in his hand, &amp; arrowes by his ſide, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is no leſſe vanitie to affirme that he is a curteous child, or froward old man, &amp; that he ſpringeth from idlenes and humane iolitie. I command you therfore <hi>Signior Guirino</hi> (if my fauor be with you of any worth) that you dilate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this ſubiect, becauſe I am aſſured, that al will attende you with great pleaſure and contentment, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire euerie one hath to knowe the Tyrant, or rather this greedie deuourer of humane hearts. A moſt grieuous burden (thriſe excellent queene) doth your maieſtie lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my ſhoulders (anſwered <hi>Guicino</hi>) in ſodainly enioyning mee to entreate, of ſo high an argument, as loue is, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation whereof, the moſt refined wits haue bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Neuertheleſſe, to make known how deare the fauor of ſo great a Queene is vnto me, I wil couragiouſly attempt the enterpriſe, hoping that loue himſelf, vnto whom fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my cradle I haue dedicated my life, wil ſtirre vp my inuention, and moue my tong, ſo that conformable to your highneſſe entention, I may make his noble eſſence &amp; other myſteries vnto him appertaining, moſt perſpicuous and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Guirino</hi> ſtaying &amp; pauſing a little with himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun afterwards in this manner. Our ſoule (moſt excellent queen) being deriued from true and eſſential beautie, there is in it ſuch an inclination, and knowledge of beauty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that no ſooner by the eye, beautie diſcouereth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16643:21"/>it ſelfe vnto her, but ſodainely without any reaſonable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reioycing with her ſelfe, ſhee is greatly delighted. Hereupon it proceedeth, that there is not ſo harſh a ſpirit and capacitie, which at the preſence of ſome beautifull thing, bee it naturall or artificiall, ſlayeth not with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and delight to beholde it, although hee can neither comprehend the proportion, order, or any other part of this Beauty. But in that (moſt illuſtrous Queene) as yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>Signior Patritio</hi> made manifeſt, Beauty humane, (as the liuely image of diuinitie) ſurmounteth all other in this inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour world, therefore deſeruedly is it that, which with his preſent apparence, hath force to enflame and kindle loue in the ſoule of man. Of which loue humane (ſeeing your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſo commandeth) I haue determined to diſcoureſe, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apart that generall argument, whereof others ſuper flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly haue entreated: it being rather a certaine inclination, which euery creature hath to his owne particular good, then a true &amp; infailible loue. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>therfore we wold attain to the prerfect knowledge of any thing, theſe foure things eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we are wont to ſeek out: firſt whether that, after which wee ſeeke, be extant: ſecondly, what it is: thirdly, from whence it hath his originall: and laſtly, what end it hath. Now therefore, I ſuppoſing, (which of all theſe Ladies and gentlemen will bee graunted vnto mee) that loue is: I will paſſe ouer vnto the other three ſought after, the which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make manifeſt vnto you, in the deſcription I ſhal ſet downe of Loue: but before I go any further, I thinke it not amiſſe to lay open ſome definitions. i. two of diuine <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; one take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for taken out I may verie well ſay, becauſe bee neuer hath defined it. <hi>Plato</hi> therfore in his book called <hi>Phedro,</hi> ſaith, that loue is no other thing, but a deſire of vnition with that which is Beautifull, and in his <hi>Conuiuio,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Diotima,</hi> he affirmeth, that loue is a deſire of bringing forth that which is beautifull: In like manner, out of the wordes of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Rhetorick, may be gathered, that loue is no other but a deſire of interchaungeable affection.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16643:22"/>The words of <hi>Platoes</hi> firſt definition be true, but yet being too much reſtrained, they declare not ſufficiently the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of loue: the ſecond is onely proper to one kinde of humane loue, and therefore cannot bee taken for a generall deſinition. That of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> notwithſtanding it bee vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, and hath his verification, as well in loue as in good will, beeing in a manner the end both of one and other, yet is it ſomewhat defectiue, becauſe there wanteth the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, as in it no mention being made of beautie, which properly doth generate and preſerue loue: but in that the defect of theſe definitions wil be made manifeſt, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that I intend to propound. I will in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further, but come to define humane loue, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the power of my ſlender wit: and admit I preuaile no further, yet by this meanes ſhall I giue occaſion to theſe learned vnderſtandings, to thinke better on it. I affirme, that loue is no other but a forcible perturbation of humane mind, ſtirred vp by ſome knowne beautie, through a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of Nature, which the louer hath towards the thing beloued, reſoluing with himſelfe in deſire, to be vnited with this beautie in loue corporeal. That loue is violent pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of our ſoule and minde, it may be confirmed by the authority of <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Conuiuio,</hi> where he termeth loue a great ſpirit or <hi>Daemon:</hi> and if the authoritie of ſo great a Philoſopher were not ſufficient, yet might theſe noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies giue ample teſtimoniall thereof, who peraduenture haue felt more then once, and often doo feele the ſame, in whoſe delicate &amp; chaſte breaſts be the moſt liuely and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent flames of loue, as likewiſe theſe amorous yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, amongſt whome peraduenture, more then one may be found, who at the preſence of ſuch a ſplendor and beautie, murmuring to himſelfe, may ſay.</p>
            <q>
               <l>If this be not blind loue what may I then, call this my fit?</l>
               <l>But Loue if that it be, O God, what manner of thing is it?</l>
            </q>
            <p>There is no doubt but among al the paſsions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16643:22"/>of minde, loue holdeth the cheefeſt place, there being no other affection that maketh alteration, as well in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as minde, then loue doth, as <hi>Petrarch</hi> wittily expreſſeth. deſcribing in a ſonnet his amorous paſsion, when hee ſayth:
<q>
                  <l>I find no peace, and yet to warre, dare not be bold:</l>
                  <l>I feare, and hope, I burne, and yet like ice am cold.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in another place,
<q>I feare and tremble, frie, and freeze.</q> That to procure loue, it is neceſſarie that beautie, as a cauſe efficient, ſhould be knowne, it may be proued by the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers authoritie, in the ninth of his Moralles, where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that it is impoſsible any one ſhould bee enamored, without hee be firſt drawne vnto it by beautie: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo hereof is in readineſſe, in that knowledge euer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before affection, which is no other but a ſodaine motion of the ſenſatiue facultie, &amp; cordial ſpirits, procured by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable or odious apprehenſion, reſoluing either into deſire of vnion or ſeperation; whereupon enſueth either pleaſure or greefe. I haue alſo placed that little clauſe, as neceſſarie in the definition of loue, through a ſecret conformitie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the louer hath with the beloued. For it is not poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any ſhould be enamored, except in finding a woman conformable in beautie to his owne proper diſpoſition, the which is teſtified by the teſtimony of <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Lyſide,</hi> where he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth, that we are enforced, to loue that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to our nature: as alſo by the authoritie of diuine <hi>Petrarch,</hi> in the ſecond <hi>Stanza</hi> of that excellent Sonnet, in the ſweete time of my firſt years, where hee ſaith:
<q>
                  <l>I ſay that from the day Loue firſt aſſailed mee,</l>
                  <l>Were many yeares yſpent, and faſt away did flee,</l>
                  <l>So that my youthful hue, I changde for graue and ſage,</l>
                  <l>With froſen thoughts my heart was burdend by that age.</l>
                  <l>Which had my heart to Adamant conuerted quite:</l>
                  <l>Nor teares my breaſt did wet, with cruel loues deſpight,</l>
                  <l>I broke not yet my ſleepe, and what was not in me,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:16643:23"/>I deemde moſt ſtrange in others when I did it ſee:</l>
                  <l>Alas what am I now? and what haue ſometimes beene?</l>
                  <l>By end the life, at euening wee the day eſteeme.</l>
                  <l>This cruell boy marke wel, of whom I do complaine,</l>
                  <l>That vntill then my garments onely did remaine,</l>
                  <l>Hit with his dart: he therefore with his wity ſnare,</l>
                  <l>A mighty Dame did catch, when ſhe was vnaware,</l>
                  <l>With whom I neuer could, or euer can preuaile,</l>
                  <l>By force, wit, penitence, but with theſe three do faile:</l>
                  <l>Theſe two haue me transformde into this ſtate you ſee,</l>
                  <l>Of me a liuing man making a Laurel tree,</l>
                  <l>Which planted in cold ground, without leaues cannot be.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Petrarch</hi> ſheweth, that hauing in his dayes ſeene many faire women, (as it is likely) hee neuer was enamored, but rather had an heart made of Adamant, till by that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre Dame hee was ſurpriſed, whoſe Beautie was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his owne proper Nature, and therefore this ſweete conformitie, is one of the principalleſt and moſt eſſentiall cauſes of Loue; which hath his originall of no other thing, then from the celeſtiall influences in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane generation: becauſe theſe infuſe ſeperately, into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing, as well without life, as liuing, and eſpecially into mans bodie, a peculiar and particular temperature, by which euery man is in ſome thing different from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in complection. From whence ſpringeth diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and appetites, in that it cannot bee denied, but that the ſenſible faculty, hauing alwaies his operation ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the body, followeth the temperature of the body; and therefore it is no maruaile (as the Poet ſayth) if euery one be tranſported by his particular delight, and that the beauty which is apt to rauiſh the minde of one, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toucheth another. This loue, which is no other, but that moſt vehement paſsion wee ſpoke of, reſolueth into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of vniting it ſelfe, in reciprocall loue, with the thing beautiful: and here let vs obſerue, that though a man hath the greater parte of his affections common with other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16643:23"/>creatures, yet is he from them verie different: for in other creatures, affection, deſire, action, if they be not hindered, they moue as it were in one moment, in that they want rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which ſhould ſtruggle with ſence. But in man, though affection fodainely mooueth, yet it is not ſo readily transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into deſire, or quickely mooned to action, in that this cannot be without the conſent of reaſon: the which as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, oftentimes permitteth not affection to breake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſire, or ſo incontinently to proceede to action: If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loue be willing to reſolue into deſire, of neceſsity rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt thereunto conſent, it beeing ſhee that perfectly knoweth the hope, which is the true foundation of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Therefore when any rare beautie or pulchritude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to our appetite, diſcouereth it ſelfe, it is not in our power at that inſtant, to reſiſt amarous affection: but if this beauty be placed in too high a ſubiect, as in a Princeſſe, hope of vnition and loue reciprocall, failing in vs by the light of reaſon, affection is not conuerted into amarous deſire, but rather into ſpeciall reuerence. By this true concluſion, we may coniecture how vainely it was ſpoken by our Poet;
<q>
                  <l>Although thou haſt thy heart placed full high aboue,</l>
                  <l>Waile not, though die thou dooſt, and languiſh in her loue.</l>
               </q> For it had beene a truer ſentence to haue ſaid:
<q>
                  <l>Who placed hath his heart mounting too neare the skie,</l>
                  <l>May well lament, if he languiſh through want, and die.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That loue changeth himſelfe into deſire of aunſwerable affection, theſe amorous and valiant Gentlemen, will ſerue me with moſt certaine and infallible teſtimonie, who ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by ſuch a deſire, to make themſelues woorthy of the reciprocall loue of their affected miſtreſſes, couet euer to performe gentle and liberall actions: and there is no doubt, but in the heart of euery noble louer, the principalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, to be beloued mutually, and that he had rather be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the vnion of loue reciprocall, than by vnion to loſe the mutuall and interchangeable affection of his deere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16643:24"/>and this may ſuffice for the definition of loue. Yet wil I not forbeare, to admoniſh theſe moſt beautifull Ladies, that they be not too preſumptuous in the title of Miſtreſſes, as though they themſelues might not likewiſe come to bee louers: For though their hearts be built of plaiſter of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, yet be they not ſo hard, but that Loue ſometimes with his golden arrow may pearſe them; therefore when I ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured, I intend aſwell women as men; and by a Louer, I giue to vnderſtand, both the one and the other. By the ſame way and meane, that amorous paſsion, in humane harts is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, as by beautie being an obiect to the ſight, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the mother thereof; ſo may we affirme with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of <hi>Petrarch,</hi> that the eies be guides vnto the path of loue: and therefore in the firſt <hi>Terzetto</hi> of his Sonnet, hee ſaith, there was a day when the Sunne was darkened.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Loue, me vnarmed altogither found:</l>
               <l>And ope did make the way, by eies, my heart to kill,</l>
               <l>Which to my teares were foordes, from whence they did diſtill.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And in the fift Stanza of the Sonet: ſo weake the threed is, whereupon my yrkeſome life depends:
<q>
                  <l>And alſo with my heart, let both thoſe lights feele ſmart,</l>
                  <l>Which to the path of loue did guide me, to depart:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And not onely the louers cies, as the way, but thoſe alſo of her beloued doe neceſſarily concurre, to the imprinting of this amorous paſsion, as affirmeth the ſame Poet in the Sonnet, Loue hath me ſet, as white vnto the ſhaft, ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>Your eies this mortall blow, did towardes me direct,</l>
                  <l>Gainſt which preuailes no time, nor place can well protect:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Sonnet:
<q>
                  <l>O cruell ſtarre, if heauens in vs haue any force,</l>
                  <l>And cruell woman, of whoſe eies I take remorce:</l>
                  <l>As eke the bow whereto I for a marke did reſt.</l>
                  <l>That made the wound whereby, with loue I do not ieſt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Sonnet:
<q>
                  <l>When by the eies into the heart profound,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:16643:24"/>A woman doth her liuely image ſend:</l>
                  <l>Then all things elſe depart away full round,</l>
                  <l>And vertue, which the ſoule doth comprehend:</l>
                  <l>Then leaues the reſt of all the members ſtraight</l>
                  <l>Inimoueable, much like a ponderous waight.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We therefore concluding with the Poet will ſay, that the eyes be thoſe that ſwallow downe the Idea of the beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and tranſport it to the Louers heart; whereupon the minde incited by that moſt delectable contentment, enters into contemplation, and feeling of that influence wherwith it is moued, and by litle and little ſet on fire, eſpecially when vnto this there commeth the reuerberation againſt them of thoſe moſt glittering beames, ſent foorth from the eies of the beloued: ſo that freſh fewell added to the former fier, all theſe together inflame with amorous heat. And as it is not in our power (moſt noble Queene) to reſiſt amorous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that which in a moment altering the vitall ſpirites, maketh impreſsion in our ſenſible facultie, ſo not being able without the conſent of reaſon, to breake foorth into deſire, it is in our power to bridle, and induce it to a mediocritie; which if we doe not, it is no more humane loue, but made like the loue of ſauage beaſts, is termed beſtiall. Wherefore as this diſordinate loue is the noriſhment of all vices, ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate loue, is the principall originall of all vertues. Leauing therefore apart this brutiſh loue, which deſerueth rather the name, of a luxurious and furious ſtorme, then of true loue, we will diuide humane loue into three ſeuerall kindes, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one from another, in reſpect of the end to which they are directed.</p>
            <p>The firſt and excellenteſt of all the reſt, like vnto the diuine of-ſpring of that celeſtiall <hi>Venus,</hi> wherein the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins immeaſurably burning, do enflame with like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the reſt of the Angelicall ſpirites, is called diuine loue. This was defined by <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phedro,</hi> to bee no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a diuine furie, which reduceth to memorie the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16643:25"/>forme of true beauty, in that farre from all brutiſh action, in the onely contemplation of his faire and deare beloued, he reſteth ſatisfied; who beholding beauty as the Image of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, raiſeth vp by that meanes his minde to meditate on that beauty which is perfect and celeſtiall. This diuine lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deſireth that his deere affected ſhould be ſet on fire, with ſo holy, chaſte, &amp; immaculate a loue towards him. With ſuch loue, not onely yong men, but olde, religious, and men mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried may be inamoted; and it is in the higheſt and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree of temperature. The ſecond kind, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminating chaſte thoughts, reioyceth onely in beholding, diſcourſing, and conuerſing with his beloued, as alſo by her to be mutually affected. This is diſcrepant, from that in the diuine louer, inſomuch as admiring humane beauty, without lifting vp the mind to that from whence ſhe had her begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hee meditateth on this beauty humane, not as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and repreſentation of Diuinitie, but as if it were moſt true and eſſentiall beutie, and reioyceth in this contentment: this is called chaſte loue, and is in the ſecond degree of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. It ſe emeth kiſsing vnto this Loue, is permitted for a reward; in that a kiſſe is rather the coniunction of ſoule then body, for by meane of a kiſſe, a moſt pleaſing paſſage, of the liuelieſt ſpirits being procured both from the one and others heart, the ſoules of louers remaine ſo bound togither by the vndiuided knot of loue, that of two ther is made one, which compounded after this maner, gouerneth two bodies, and therefore thoſe chaſtely enamored, deſire to attayne to a kiſſe, as being a true connexion of the ſoule. Wherfore the diuine Philoſopher in his <hi>Conuiuio,</hi> ſpeaking of one inamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with chaſte loue ſaith, that kiſsing, the ſoule commeth into the lippes, from whence it flieth out, and is receiued.</p>
            <p>The third kinde of humane loue, is that, which reſolueth into deſire of vnition, with the thing beautifull, not onely in minde, but alſo corporally, yet by lawful and honeſt meane; and this loue is that, which is the beginning of thrice ſacred Matrimony, and in this, not onely an vnion of reciprocall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16643:25"/>loue, but alſo a deſire of eternitie is diſcouered; for by meane of this laſciuious loue, a man communicating his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per kinde, beeing fraile, maketh himſelfe eternall. Thus much <hi>Plato</hi> gaue to vnderſtand, when he ſaid, Loue is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of bringing forth that which is beautifull: although this definition hath by others beene diuerſly interpreted, they ſuppoſing, that the diuine philoſopher vnderſtoode it by that loue, wherewith <hi>Socrates</hi> loued faire and goodly yong men; which reſolued into a deſire of generating in their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wittes, his noble conceits and morall vertues. There fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth (moſt excellent Queene) and with this I will finiſh my diſcourſe, as the ſhadow a body, ſo this loue, a moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell paſsion, which many times with his bitter poyſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palleth and infeſteth the happy ſtate of the louer: This is wicked iealouſie, which is no other but a paſsion that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaileth and freezeth the inamoured heart by imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of leeſing, or to be hindered in the mutuall affection of his beloued: This taketh beginning and nouriſhment, from the louers vnderſtanding the want of ſome perfection in himſelfe, which in his corriuall is aboundant and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Heere Signior <hi>Guirino</hi> held his peace, and iudging that hee had ſufficiently ſatisfied the commaundement of the Queene, would haue retired himſelfe. When the Queene beckened vnto him, that he ſhould ſit ſtill, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Lady <hi>Tarquinia Molza,</hi> with all the other gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they ſhould moue queſtions to Signior <hi>Guirino</hi> in the argument of loue, that by this gentle exerciſe, they might beguile the time, till the comming of his Highneſſe.</p>
            <p>This noble deſire of your Maieſtie, aunſwered then the Lady <hi>Tarquinia</hi> ſmiling, is vnto me ſingular good happe, and fortune, ſeeing by this occaſion I hope to reduce my minde to tranquilitie, which now is greatly troubled for that which Signior <hi>Guirino</hi> hath ſayd, holding opinion, that loue is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in vs, by a ſecret conformitie of nature, which the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath with his beloued, and that this conformitie depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16643:26"/>on the heauens: which being true, how ſhall I be free from this amorous ſtorme, notwithſtanding I now ride to my great contentment in ſafe porte and harbour? for howe ſhall I be able to auoyde, that a beautie conformable to my Nature preſenting it ſelfe before my eies, I may not enter into this tempeſtuous ſea of loue? I beſeech you therefore by your wonted curteſie (Signior <hi>Guirino</hi>) explane vnto me, whether loue commeth by election or deſtinie. You ſhould (Madam <hi>Tarquinia</hi>) bee ouer highly conceited in your ſelfe, anſwered <hi>Guirino,</hi> and too cruell againſt loue, if as you are alwayes beloued, ſo you ſhould be ſecure from being inamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that deſtiny could not chaſtice your ingratitude: that loue proceedeth from celeſtiall influence, it is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Petrarch,</hi> and eſpecially in the fift Stanza of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, or ſeſtine, which beginneth thus: <hi>To any creature that doth harbour on the earth,</hi> ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>I thinke that in the wood there feedeth no ſuch beaſt</l>
                  <l>By night, nor yet by day, that is, ſo faire at leaſt</l>
                  <l>As ſhe whome I doe ſeeke, by ſhadow, and the ſonne</l>
                  <l>Not weary, for my ſleepe, when morning it doth come,</l>
                  <l>So though my mortall body on the earth doth mous,</l>
                  <l>Yet doth my firme deſire come from the ſtarres aboue.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here hee confeſſeth that his firme and conſtant loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Laura,</hi> proceeded from the ſtarres, that is, from cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall influence, and in the ſeuenth Stanza of the Song. That my old ſweete, yet wicked Lord, ſpeaking in the perſon of Loue, he ſaith thus:
<q>
                  <l>As each one by his ſtar, doth ſeeme to be ordainde,</l>
                  <l>From ſeruile loue of maides, I could not be detaind.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Sonnet, <hi>It may be ſome will thinke that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending her:</hi> in the third <hi>Terzetto</hi> hee ſaith:
<q>
                  <l>Thy ſtate diuine, by mortall tongue cannot expreſſed be:</l>
                  <l>Loue by election doth not drawe, but euen by destinie.</l>
               </q>

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:16643:26"/>To abſolue this doubt, and not leaue you perplexed, I ſay that loue is planted in the heart of man by deſtinie, but it taketh there no roote, but by election: This is euident by the definition of Loue: For he by a knowne beautie is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, through the ſecret conformitie of nature, that the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath with his affected, ſo that it is not in our power, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conformable beautie diſcouereth it ſelfe to effect, that in vs amorous paſsion ſhould not bee mooued, as likewiſe wee cannot procure, that others affections, whoſe ſubiect is the part iraſcible, may not exerciſe their force, amiddeſt feare, and ſuch like: but in that theſe affections cannot reſolue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſire, as we haue ſaid, if reaſon do not thereto conſent, from whoſe agreement ſpringeth election; it followeth that loue cannot change into deſire, or take roote in mans heart, but by election, which is an action of free will, neither can it by the ſtars be violated, or haue hinderance, as <hi>Petrarch</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe affirmeth, in the laſt Stanze but one of his ſong: Alas that I am ignorant where hope is to bee found, ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>No planet doth mee thus condemne to waile,</l>
                  <l>When that my ſight is dimde by mortall vaile;</l>
                  <l>What fault is in the ſtarres, or things in beauty that preuaile?</l>
               </q> The Poet couering to infer, that though the ſtarres encline, yet inforce they not a man, to offer himſelfe as it were a pray to loue, but all proceedeth from our election. I am but ſlooderly comforted, aunſwered the Lady <hi>Tarquinia,</hi> in this your concluſion, for if it bee true which both <hi>Petrarch</hi> and <hi>Arioſto</hi> affirme, that loue depriueth libertie, and that he can be brideled with no bit (election being an action of freewil,) ſhall haue no place in his Kingdome, and in trueth experience ſheweth, that Loue manageth his Empire with violence, and where there is leaſt hope of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Loue reciprocall, there baniſhing reaſon from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16643:27"/>her ſeate, he principally maketh triall of his force. Vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Mirrha</hi> was inflamed with the loue of her owne father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerable <hi>Canace</hi> with her brother <hi>Macareus,</hi> and vnbride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Phedra</hi> with the loue of moſt chaſte <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome by amorous paſsion: <hi>Paſiphae</hi> for loue of a Bull fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the woods, and that incontinent young man <hi>Guido</hi> animated, by this moſt cruell tyrant defiled in the Temple, that moſt beautifull ſtatue of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus:</hi> and who will ſay, that the foundations of theſe loues were layed in any action of reaſon, and not confeſſe, that theſe infortunate louers were prouoked to this diſordinate loue, rather by deſtiny than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection? To conclude therefore, that loue taketh roote in mans heart, by election, in my iudgement is no other, but to open the eyes of loue, and of a blinde boy, to make him a wakefull and vigilant olde man. My concluſion, learned Lady, (aunſwered <hi>Guirino</hi>) ought to giue you ſo much the more conſolation, by how much for the moſt part it falleth out to be true, and after ſuch a manner true, as thoſe vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and ſordide affections, which ſo greatly amaze you, are recounted but for wonderfull accidents. Vndoubtedly they were beſtial inamorations, as brutiſh likewiſe all thoſe ſhal be, which are rooted in humane heartes, without the action of reaſon: of which you are not to preſume in your ſelfe, in whome reaſon vſeth to commaund, and ſence to obey. For vertue hauing already taken certain poſſeſsion of your moſt beautifull minde, it will be eaſie for you, euer to extinguiſh the diſordinate flames of Loue; but if deſtiny ſet before your eies, conformable beauty, you beholding it as the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diuinity, and ſauiſhed with diuine loue, will proſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transforme your ſelfe into the ſame diuinity.</p>
            <p>I am contented to accept (Signior <hi>Guirino</hi>) of theſe laſt wordes, anſwered the Lady <hi>Tarquinia,</hi> no leſſe for commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then conſolation, neither will I vrge further: Then the Lady <hi>Camilla Canala,</hi> a matrone of magnificont pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and high witte, tooke occaſion to propound a doubt; I would alſo willingly know ſaid ſhe, ſeeing loue is planted
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16643:27"/>in humane hearts by deſtinie, and taketh roote by election, whether it be in the Louers power to extirpate it, for of this I greatly doubt. You haue great reaſon to doubt (ſaid <hi>Guiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>) for by the Philoſophers conſent, it is much more hard to reſiſt the appetite of deſire, then of anger. And <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timeo</hi> affirmeth, that cupiditie giueth no eare to reaſon, but no ſooner is ſtirred vp by ſence, then that immediatly ſhe is rauiſhed, by theſe viewed repreſentations: in which opinion <hi>Plutarch</hi> agreeth. Loue then beeing the principall affection of the part concupiſcent, and yet notwithſtanding the beauty of the beloued being to the louer repreſented by ſence and imagination, as it hath annexed vnto it I knowe not what manner of violence, which forcibly rauiſheth the ſoule of the louer, ſo is it impoſsible that the louer taken by that baite, ſhould cleare himſelfe, as <hi>Petrarch</hi> affirmeth of himſelfe, ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>The more I hope my heart will ſhun this cruell baite,</l>
                  <l>The more on beauties hooke to faſten, I awaite.</l>
               </q> And in another place alſo, ſpeaking of himſelfe, he clearely ſheweth, that it is not in the louers power to breake the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous cord, but in that ſonnet eſpecially.
<q>
                  <l>If I rauiſh't with fond deſire, do make great haſte,</l>

                  <l>And calling backe my ſelfe into ſecurer path,</l>
                  <l>Shee to attend me then, the leſſer pleaſure hath:</l>

From wil this ſo liberall a graunt (moſt gracious Lady) had our free his original, ſo that it is in our power, to liue like a plant, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature like a man, &amp; laſtly as an Angell: for if a man addict himſelf only to feeding and nouriſhment, hee becommeth a Plante, if to things ſenſuall, he is as a brute beaſt, if to things reaſonable &amp; ciuil, he groweth a celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al creature: but if he exalt the beautiful gift of his mind, to thinges inuiſible and diuine, hee tranſfourmeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16643:29"/>into an Angel; and to conclude, becommeth the ſonne of God. To affirme therefore, that wee haue not power to free our ſelues from loue, after he hath planted his roote in our hearts, is no other but to reiect the moſt high gift gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs by the chiefe creator, for our great perfection, and to ſay that we can liue no otherwiſe then creatures irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, which are wholly bent to ſenſualitie, is a matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither falſe, ſeeing by the act of reaſon, we may reduce all affections to mediocritie, and pacifie theſe diſordinate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our mind: and amongſt the reſt, this of loue.

That diſtance increſeth loue (anſwered <hi>Gui rino</hi>) is very conformable to reaſon, by howe much the want is greater, by ſo much the more is deſire augmented: The Louer therefore by reaſon of ſeperation, being more deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of vnion, cauſeth his amorous deſire to be the greater, or at leaſt impaireth it not at all. As <hi>Petrarch</hi> affirmeth in the laſt <hi>Terzetto,</hi> when time and place before mine eies I ſet, ſaying.</p>
            <q>
               <l>That ſunne which on mine eyes alone doth ſhine,</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:16643:29"/>Here <hi>Petrarch</hi> ſheweth that his being in <hi>Italy</hi> farre from <hi>Laura,</hi> did not extenuate his loue, in that the beauty therof burned ſo much the more ardently, and remained alwaies the more freſh in memorie, and confirmed. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I (moſt famous Lady) to reſolue this doubt, make this arbitrement, that if this ſeparation be but for ſhort time, it doth not diminiſh, but rather increaſe loue, through the hope of ſodaine returne: but if it bee for any long time or continuance, it doth not onely impaire, but vtterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh loue, which is plainely manifeſted by this reaſon: for by what meane loue is procured, by the ſelfe ſame it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. Loue therefore hauing production in mans heart, by meane of the eyes and ſight, wee may with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon couclude, that the ſight of his deare beloued, is that, which ſweetely nouriſheth loue: and therefore we ſee, that one nor other thing, louers are more ententiue, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their affected: whereas by great diſtant ſeparation, the foode and nouriſhment of loue failing, of neceſsitie pining away through want, hee muſt needes bee weakened, and in the end periſh. The Lady <hi>Syluia</hi> remained ſatisfied, and Madam <hi>Camilla Coſtabile</hi> peceruing all the companie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect hir propoſition, without further delay, mooued this queſtion: whether iealoſie were a token of great loue. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Guirino</hi> replied, it ſeemeth noble Lady, that ieloſie is a ſigne of ſpeciall loue, for we vſually ſay, that whoſo greatly loueth, hee is not without feare, ielouſie being no other but a maruailous feare, as before wee affirmed. To reſolue therefore this doubt, I ſay that the heart of him greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored, is the proper ſubiect of this moſt bitter paſsion, which we terme ieloſie, yet doth it not ſo preſently take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, which is a manifeſt ſigne, that the great heat then beginneth to qualifie: and when ieloſie proceedeth ſo far that hope remaineth dead, by the victorie feare hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then that ſo feruent loue, enclining by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towardes his contrarie, is tranſformed into hatred and diſdaine. Ielouſie therefore is a ſigne of affectionate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16643:30"/>loue paſt, &amp; ſlender affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſent. This anſwer pleaſed the Lady <hi>Camilla.</hi> And the Queene beckened to the Lady coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe of <hi>Sala,</hi> that ſhe ſhould moue her ſcruple: This moſt beautifull, and in all her actions and geſtures moſt gracious Lady, beſides her other rare qualities, is ſo readie of vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and full of ingenious conceits, that ſhe procureth the aſtoniſhment of all them that behold, or attend her. After ſhee had therefore pauſed a while, ſhee ſpoke in this ſors. You haue defined loue to be no other but a defire of vnion; if this were true, it would likewiſe follow, that in things beloued, after the vnion and poſſeſsion of beautie, loue ſhuld reſt extinguiſhed: for where there is no want, there can bee no deſire, and yet experience teacheth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, that after enioyance of the beloued, we yet in loue make further progreſsion. My queſtion therefore ſhall bee, whether after poſſeſsion of beautie, loue remaineth extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>This doubt (moſt excellent lady, is of no ſmal importance) anſwered <hi>Guirino</hi>) becauſe it diſſenteth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaſon, that we ſhuld deſire the things we haue alreadie in our power. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I would affirme, (alwaies excepting better iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) that loue may be maintained liuing in two wants, the one is in the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to of ſimple vnion, &amp; the other in want of vnion perpetual: after enioyance of beauty, the firſt want of ſimple vnion ceaſeth, and then arifeth the want of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnion, for when wee enioy a thing preſent, yet are wee by and by in want, of that which is to come, which want is of force, to maintaine liuing this deſire, that wee terme Loue: and therefore in that State, loue is no other but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of perpetuall enioying the thing beloued. With this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſtinction <hi>Guirino</hi> ſatisfied the Lady Counteſſe and all the ſtanders by: when the Lady <hi>Camilla Beuelacqua</hi> caſt out her doubt after this manner: In the definition of Loue, you affirmed, that it ſprung from the knowledge of Beautie: this in my iudgement bringeth with it ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, in that we ſee by experience, that ſome contemning
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16643:30"/>the thing truely beautifull, grow enamoured with that, which to all others ſeemeth deformed and odious, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarily you muſt affirme, that either deformitie to another may ſeeme beautie, or elſe that not alwaies beautie, but deformity alſo ſometimes, may be the mother of loue: cleare therefore vnto mee this doubt, that your deſinition remaine not vnperfect. As things materiall and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, fayre Ladie, aunſwered <hi>Guirino,</hi> can neuer bee ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, as that in them ſome defect may not be diſcouered, ſo doo they neuer carrie with them ſuch deformitie, that ſome ſteppes of beauty may not appeare, for the euill diſpoſition of matter cannot ſo greatly reſiſt the Ideall forme and reaſon, but that in it the excellencie of the diuine artificer will diſcouer it ſelfe. They therefore, which vnto many ſeeme deformed, are neuer without ſome beautiful poynt, which beeing neuer ſo little, when it ſhall be conformable to anothers nature, in ſuch a one will it be of ſuch force to ſtirre vppe Loue, and there is no doubt but our mindes, as in the reſt, ſo alſo in loue, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie diuers, and therefore ſome are enamoured with a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mouth, and ſweete ſmiling countenance, others with a fayre breaſt, or iuory necke, ſome with delicate and white hands, others with the breath and comely grace, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hidden beautie in a woman: who no ſooner baite theyr wings on this louing limetwigge, but blinde in all other deformities of their beloued, beholding onely that parte wherewith theyr minde is contented, they deeme their owne miſtreſſe of all other moſt woorthie, to bee beloued and ſerued: and ſo likewiſe, the leaſt blemiſh in any faire woman may preuaile ſo farre in his minde, vnto whoſe nature and diſpoſition it ſhall bee diſproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and diſpleaſing, as contemning all other perfections, hee ſhall iudge her vnwoorthie of any mans loue. This therefore is true, that loue proceedeth from knowne beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, becauſe of deformitie, hatred, and of beautie, loue is the legitimate of spring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:16643:31"/>This anſwere was commended: and the Lady <hi>Leonora Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crati</hi> further replied: tell me <hi>Signior Guirino,</hi> if loue bee the ſelfe ſame with deſire, why doth your definitions, lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, call it in queſtion, and yet <hi>Leon</hi> the Iew in his third dialogue of loue, ſaith, that loue is no other but a deſire, which is alſo conformable to experience, ſeeing wee loue becauſe we deſire, and deſire becauſe we loue. <hi>Leon</hi> the Iew, a man queſtionleſſe of quicke and excellent witte, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Guirino,</hi> hath in this committed an error as one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth him ſelfe in the firſt Dialogue, wherein hee diſtinguiſheth loue from deſire: but to reſolue your doubt, I auerre, that if we conſider loue as an affection, it is as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from deſire, as the beginning from the middeſt: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loue is that ſodaine and firſt motion, which groweth in mans minde through apprehenſion of conformable beauty, which without conſent of hope, diſturbeth that minde, and altering the heart and deſire grounded vppon hope, followeth loue, it being a meane to attain to the end, which is vnion with beautie. Notwithſtanding, loue is taken for deſire, becauſe after the firſt motion it is tranſformed into deſire, and then it is true that we loue, becauſe we deſire, and deſire, becauſe we loue. The L. <hi>Leonora</hi> replied no further: but Madam <hi>Tarquinia Molza:</hi> It ſeemeth, added ſhee, that this your concluſion is contrarie to the Philoſopher, for he in his Politikes ſaith thus, that none can loue, except he firſt be delighted with beautie, and he thus delighted in beautie, loueth not ſodainely, but then loueth, when he deſireth, the thing beloued beeing abſent, and hath to it as great a zeale being preſent.</p>
            <p>Our of theſe wordes wee collect, that deſire preceed eth and followeth not loue Wee muſt obſerue (learned Ladie) (aunſwered <hi>Guirino</hi>) that the Philoſopher ſpeaketh not of loue in this place, as it is a perturbation, and that firſt motion by vs before ſpoken of: but intendeth it by louing action, deſirous to inferre, that the Louer is not brought to ſuch acte, before Loue bee reſolued into a deſire of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16643:31"/>the thing beloued; and this is ſo farre from being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that it is conformable to all our pofitions. The Ladie <hi>Tarquinia</hi> highly commended this cleere explication of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotles</hi> wordes, and vſing no further ſpeech, the Lady <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria Taſſona</hi> propounded her doubt after this ſort. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you haue diſcourſed of loue, we giuing attention, not knowing as yet, whether loue be a good or diſcommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, when notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding this moſt principally ſhuld be taught: for all our deſires and actions being moued from the knowledge of good and euill, we flying alwayes known euill, and following the good: who is hee that would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde loue, if he thought it wicked, or would not folowe it, eſteeming it good: reſolue me therefore of this doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue be good or wicked. <hi>Petrarch</hi> wittily diſputeth, (anſwered <hi>Guirino</hi>) vpon this probleme, in the Song,
<q>
                  <l>That my old Lord, Wicked, though ſweete he ſeeme,</l>
                  <l>Made to appeere before the Queene on hie:</l>
                  <l>Whom of our parts diuine, men gouerneſſe do deeme,</l>
                  <l>Hauing her ſeate aboue the lofty azurde skie.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Where hee faining to cite loue, before the tribunall of reaſon, accuſeth him as wicked and peruerſe: and loue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth him ſelfe; in the end of which conflict, reaſon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard, both the one and other part, leaueth the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie vndecided, ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>Suffice it; that to your complaints,</l>
                  <l>I haue attended well:</l>
                  <l>But yet more time this ſtrife requires,</l>

            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the reaſons are not of light importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by which our minds ſhould be induced to beleeue, that loue is a wicked thing. Firſt, in that it is an exceeding perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our mind; and perturbations being contrary to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, which is one of the principalleſt conditions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicitie, being good of it ſelfe, and to be deſired, and therefore of neceſsitie al thoſe of themſelues are wicked and odious: ſecondly, becauſe he depriueth vs of libertie: thirdly,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16643:32"/>for that further he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tending with reaſon, auoydeth al good operations: As <hi>Petrarch</hi> affirmeth, complaining him ſelfe, of loue, in the third Stanza of this vnderwritten Sonnet, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<q>
                  <l>Theſe haue me made leſſe for to loue my God,</l>
                  <l>Then that I ought, and leſſe my ſelfe alſo,</l>
                  <l>One woman hath me ſcourged with this rod,</l>
                  <l>That equally, all thoughts procure me woe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And a little more vnderneath,
<q>
                  <l>Thus am I now diſpoilde of my ſweete libertie,</l>
                  <l>By my moſt cruell foe, whome I accuſe and flie.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the triumph of loue:
<q>
                  <l>Of vs I will now ſpeake, and firſt of that great man,</l>
                  <l>That of our life and libertie diſpoile vs can,</l>
                  <l>The ſame whome all the world calles Loue, as I doe learne:</l>
                  <l>But bitter, as you ſee, and better ſhall diſcerne,</l>
                  <l>If of your quiet thoughts, he proue the ſoueraigne ſire,</l>
                  <l>As in our hearts his thoughts do kindle burning fier.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And further, loue is a cauſe, that looſing our ſelues, wee are transformed into another, as <hi>Petrarch</hi> affirmeth of him ſelfe in the Song by me cited.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Theſe two haue me transformed into the ſtate you ſee,</l>
               <l>Of me, a liuing man, making a Lawrell tree,</l>
               <l>Which planted in cold ground, without leaues cannot be.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And in the third chapter of loue:
<q>
                  <l>Of my great enemy the path I ſearched out,</l>
                  <l>And ſeeking her to finde, I was transformd throughout:</l>
                  <l>As louer to be lou'd, poſſeſſed out of doubt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariosto</hi> alſo ſuppoſeth, that Loue, for the moſt part, is a wicked thing, when he ſaith:
<q>
                  <l>Loue we do not therefore ſo wicked alwayes find,</l>
                  <l>But that ſometimes he helpes, aſwell as hurtes the minde.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding moſt gente Lady, I am of a contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and hold, that loue is a moſt excellent thing, and neceſſary to a good and happy life: but I vnderſtand not this by beſtiall loue: For this vndoubtedly is wicked, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16643:32"/>that which depriueth of libertie, and auoydeth all good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, there being no greater ſeruitude then ſin: and this peraduenture <hi>Petrarch</hi> vnderſtoode when he ſaid:</p>
            <q>Theſe haue me cauſed leſſe to loue my God,</q>
            <p>But ſpeaking of other ſorts of loue, all are good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to a man: and comming to the firſt, which for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, is called diuine loue: this is moſt excellent, in that being a deſire of vnition, with the thing beutifull, as the true Image of Diuinitie, by meane of humane creature, it lifteth vp the minde to loue beautie, and is inflamed with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loue towardes his Creator. Neither can that loue be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wicked, which burſteth out into deſire, of generating by honeſt meane, the thing beautifull, in that being ioyned with a deſire of eternitie, of al other, it procureth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind. But what ſhal we ſay of the other kind of loue, placed in the ſecond degree of temperance? may we peraduenture affirme it wicked, ſeeing farre from all bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh action, in the contemplation of beautie onely, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall affection of his deare beloued he contents him ſelfe? This is that perfect degree of loue, which enflameth the hearts of men to glorious enterpriſes. Wherefore <hi>Petrarch</hi> calling to minde his errour, in this Sonnet vnder all cadged, when he ſo raſhly indignified Loue, in the ſixt Stanza, and alſo in the reſt of the Sonnet he faineth him ſelfe by loue, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed of ingratitude, ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>My mortall foe, with bitter frumps aſſayes,</l>
                  <l>But, woman, marke the other part, alwayes:</l>
                  <l>Which ſhal the truth declare with faithfull heart,</l>
                  <l>How thus ingrate, this man came to depart:</l>
                  <l>In youth he did apply, him ſelfe to ſelling</l>
                  <l>Wordes wholly vaine, and lies eke eftſoones telling:</l>
                  <l>And as it ſeemes, he was no whit aſhamde:</l>
                  <l>Moou'd by this meane, to make me eke be blamde,</l>
                  <l>With my delight, which doth moſt pure remaine</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:16643:33"/>From his deſire, which would me gladly ſtaine:</l>
                  <l>And in ſweete life, which he vexation calles</l>
                  <l>Some follies to lament, he freſhly falles,</l>
                  <l>When by my help, he glorious doth remaine,</l>
                  <l>Which of him ſelfe, he neuer could attaine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And alittle afterwardes in the ſame Song:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder my wings I did him ſo conuoy,</l>
                  <l>That Knights and Ladies in his ſpeech tooke ioy,</l>
                  <l>And afterwards him to that fame did bring,</l>
                  <l>As that mongſt ripeſt wittes his name did ring:</l>
                  <l>And of his wordes, conſeruaes they did make,</l>
                  <l>Who in his ſpeech ſo great delight did take:</l>
                  <l>Though now in court ſome ſycophant he be,</l>
                  <l>Or with the vulgar ſort in baſe degree.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the laſt Stanza ſauing one, hee affirmeth that this loue is acceptable to God and men.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Neuer was nightly dreame, ſo fond and vaine,</l>
               <l>As that opinion, which he doth retaine</l>
               <l>Of vs: whome now he perfectly doth know</l>
               <l>Fauourd of God aboue, and men below:</l>
               <l>This lofty ſire, for this laments Itrow.</l>
            </q>
            <p>We will conclude therfore, that loue is a good and ſweet thing: and more, whoſoeuer findeth not him ſelfe inueigled with ſome of theſe louing ſnares, is but a ſottiſh man, and of the common ſort. It remaineth that I anſwere the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie arguments, for better vnderſtanding: Bee it therefore knowne vnto you, that the perturbations and affections of the minde, are no other but ſodaine and forcible motions of the concupiſcent &amp; angry faculties ſtirred vp by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things delightfull or noyſome, as I haue ſaid, theſe being procured by Nature her ſelfe, who doth nothing in vaine, or which is not conformable to diuine prouidence, and therefore cannot be ſaide to be wicked; for that were no other than to reprehend God, and Nature her ſelfe, who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16643:33"/>gaue vnto man the vertue of the angry and concupiſcent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: affections therefore in themſelues, are rather good and neceſſary to the creatures and man, than wicked; for without them, the parts indiuiduall, and kinde, could not be preſerued, conſidering that theſe moue the creature to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet may they be wicked in a man, when reſoluing into deſire, they obay not reaſon, for then they become brutiſh: wherefore affections touching man, may be compared to a horſe, who bridled, is very good and profitable, but hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full without bit; becauſe caſily hee carieth the rider awaye headlong, affections being greater benefite to man, then to other vnreaſonable creatures: for man without affections, ſhould be alſo without vertue, vertue being no other, then an habit, imprinted in our angry &amp; concupiſcent faculties, by meane of which all other affections are eaſily reduced to mediocritie, and therefore, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, concupiſcence and anger be neceſſary, to ſtirre vppe temperance, continence, tollerance, and fortitude. And the ſame Saint in the fourteenth booke of the cittie of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that affections agree wel, with the beloued of God; ſaying: that the Cittizens of the holy cittie, who liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God, in the pilgrimage of this life, do feare, are angrie, deſirous, ſad, and merry: but becauſe in theſe, loue hath a good ordination, in them all theſe perturbations are moderate and good: wherevppon that ſhrill Trumpet of truth ſaid: be angrie, but ſinne not: to which opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming my ſelfe, I alſo ſaie; loue Oyee gentle yong men, and be enamoured you faire, and moſt gratious Ladies, for loue is a good thing; but ſinne not. This excellent conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was with great contentment, eſpecially of the vong gentlemen accepted and praiſed: but after their whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſomwhat ceaſſed, the Lady Counteſſe <hi>Tieni,</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of moſt loftie conceit, whoſe turne it was to propound, bethinking her ſelfe a little. At laſt: I would willingly know ſaide ſhe, whether the beloued, be bound to reciprocation in loue, and by what reaſon: if we enter into conſideration
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16643:34"/>of Loues definition, which you Signior <hi>Guirino</hi> haue made, this ſeemeth an Iniunction, not onely of courteſie, but alſo of neceſsitie. For that ſecret conformitie of nature, which is betweene the louer and the beloued, as it forceth him ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored to loue, ſo ought it to vrge in her affected, an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loue. For beſides that (crediting me) things of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable nature, ſhould haue a conformable deſire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. Yet further, if wee attribute any thing to <hi>Dant</hi> a Poet of great authoritie, wee will be ready to affirme that Loue is ſo iuſt a Lord, that he exempteth none beloued fro louing, but with his mighty power, and burning firebrands he enflameth the hearts of all them beloued, with loue mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall towardes their louers. Notwithſtanding how may wee credite this, beholding the teares and hot ſighes of theſe ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored yong Gentlemen, who ſhew manifeſt tokens of the crueltie of their ingratefull Miſtreſſes? Putte mee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of this doubt. <hi>Ariosto</hi> and <hi>Petrarch</hi> were of contrary opinion to <hi>Dant,</hi> anſwered <hi>Guirino,</hi> who in diuers places affirme, that Loue doth not force and binde the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued to affect; but on the contrary, ſeldome are the deſires of her beloued, correſpondent to thoſe of her louer: and therefore <hi>Ariosto</hi> complaining him ſelfe, ſaith:
<q>
                  <l>Wherefore doth Loue vniuſt, ſo ſeldome frame our will,</l>
                  <l>To anſwer him with loue, with loue whom we do kill,</l>
                  <l>Perfidious wretch, from whence doth it proceede,</l>
                  <l>That thou with diſcordance, two ſeuerall hearts doſt feede?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And alittle after:
<q>
                  <l>Why doſt thou laugh and ioy, feede, and maintaine thy life:</l>
                  <l>Procuring from the eyes, fountaines of teares by ſtrife.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Petrarch</hi> maketh the ſubiect, of one parte of his Sonnets and Songs, ſometimes of the crueltie and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his <hi>Laura,</hi> otherwhiles of the treachery of loue, and eſpecially in the Sonnet,
<q>There was a day when ſunne obſcured darke:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:16643:34"/>Saying in the laſt <hi>Terzetto:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Loue me (alas) vnarmed, altogether found,</l>
                  <l>And ope did make the way, by eies, my heart to kill,</l>
                  <l>When I transfixed by his greeuous mortall wound,</l>
                  <l>Made of my eies wet foordes, from whence teares did diſtille</l>
                  <l>Yet as I thinke by that, he little honour gaind,</l>
                  <l>Wounding me in ſuch ſtate, wherein I was detaind,</l>
                  <l>You armed, not his bowe, once to beholde conſtraind.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Sonnet by me cited, he ſayth, ſpeaking of loue:
<q>
                  <l>This cruell boy market well of whom I now complaine,</l>
                  <l>That vntill then my garments onely did remaine,</l>
                  <l>Hit with his dart: he therefore in his wily ſnare</l>
                  <l>Amightie Dame did catch, when ſhe was vnaware,</l>
                  <l>With whom I neuer could, or euer can preuaile,</l>
                  <l>By force, wit, penitence, but with theſe three do faile.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the third Stanza of the Sonnet which beginneth:
<q>In time when heauens are furiouſly enclinde,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hee ſaith:
<q>
                  <l>Ah cruell Loue, that doſt me thus enforce,</l>
                  <l>Of this wilde beaſt, cauſer of my remorce,</l>
                  <l>The voyce to follow, pace, and eke the path,</l>
                  <l>When ſhe vnbound, doth flie farre from thy wrath.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For abſolution therefore of this doubt, I ſay that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conformitie which is betweene the louer and beloued, is a conformitie betweene the obiect and forcible power, for the beloued with her beautie, concurreth as obiect, and there is but ſeldome conformitie betweene the one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers power: And therefore it may eaſily fall out, that the beautie of the affected may bee apte and conformable, to mooue the minde of the Louer, when in very deede
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16643:35"/>the beautie of the Louer, ſhall not haue the like conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the minde of the beloued, or be preualent to kindle in her amorous paſſion. For this cauſe the Poets fained, that Loue had two ſorts of darts, that is ſome gilded, and others of lead, and that thoſe gilded had power to enflame, &amp; thoſe of lead to congeale &amp; freeſe: as alſo that he pearced louers with his golden ſhafts, when the beloued, were for the moſt part ſtricken with the leaden ones, and therfore <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch</hi> willing to cleare him ſelfe, ſweareth ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>If I may ſaie ſo much, Loue with his golden dart</l>
                  <l>Chargeth on me, when thoſe of lead, fall to her part.</l>

            <p>Notwithſtanding ſhe beloued, is bound by election, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the loiall and faithfull ſeruice of her ſeruant, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne the like mutuall affection, which not doing, ſhe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into the errour of ingratitude, in that ſhee beloued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth ſecret honour and commendation, by this affection of hir louer, ſhe ſhewing in that moſt notable perfection, &amp; ſuch, as that it vrgeth him to be enamored, to loue and ſerue her, and ſo much the more ſhe muſt holde herſelf bound, if ſhe perceiue her ſelfe beloued with one of thoſe kindes of loue before rehearſed: for if ſhee obſerue her ſelfe affected with this brutiſh and ſordide loue, ſhe is no waies bound to anſwerable affection, neither for this ſhal ſhe be deemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate, but rather in hating ſuch a louer, ſhe deſerueth praiſe and commendation. The Lady Counteſſe replied no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And Madam <hi>Camilla Moſti</hi> propounded her doubt, which was, whether it were better to loue or bee beloued. That to loue is better (anſwered <hi>Guirino</hi>) may be affirmed by the Philoſophers authoritie, for to loue is action, and with ſome contentment, being good, but from the beloued there proceedeth no action: and moreoner it is better to knowe then be knowne, and the Louer knoweth, but ſhee affected as hauing loue made to her, may bee depriued of knowledge, and therefore thinges without life may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16643:35"/>but neuer loue: finally, the louer in louing, exerciſeth the work of charitie, which doth not the beloued: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Philoſopher affirmeth, that to delight in louing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to be beloued, is a more commendable thing, and a ſigne of greater excellencie in good cuſtome and faſhion. On the other ſide, it ſeemeth, that to bee beloued is greater perfection; for to loue, being the ſame as to deſire, proueth want of perfection in the louer, wherein ſhe beloued doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound: and further, by how much the final cauſe is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo much doth the beloued exceed in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the louer, in that ſhe affected concurreth as the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and deſired end, and the louer is procured to loue, in fauour of her affected, or to receiue from her ſome perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now clearing this doubt, I ſay, that this word to loue, may be interpreted in two ſenſes; one is, to deſire vnition with the thing beloued, to the ende to obtaine perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from it; the other, in deſiring to giue vnto the thing beloued ſome perfection. In the firſt ſenſe, as riches is better than pouertie, ſo is it better to be beloued than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>And in this manner are the kindes of humane loue fette downe by me; for the louer ſeeketh vnion with the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to obtaine perfection from her beautie, where of hee hath want. After this ſort likewiſe dooth the creature loue his Creator, ſeeking vnition with him, for to participate of his perfection. In the ſecond ſence, it is a thing much more excellent to loue, than bee beloued: for in the louer wee ſuppoſe plenty, and in the beloued penury. With this loue God loueth the creature, and deſireth to vnite it with his diuine Maieſtie, to reach vnto it full perfection. With this loue the Prince loueth his ſubiects, and the greater his inferior, to giue and not receiue perfection.</p>
            <p>Out of this wee haue ſpoken, you (moſt honourable Lady) ſhall gather this ſingular concluſion, that all loues haue their originall from aboundaunce or defect, as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Philoſopher affirmeth in his <hi>Conuiuio,</hi> and in his booke
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16643:36"/>called <hi>Lyſide,</hi> faining that <hi>Poro,</hi> which ſignifieth riches, is the father, and <hi>Penia,</hi> which importeth pouertie, is the mother of loue. For loue ſpringeth either from the penurie of the Louer, or wealth of the beloued, or from want in the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ſuperaboundance in the Louer. The Lady <hi>Camilla</hi> commended the anſwer, and all the other Gentlewomen, wiſhing within themſelues, to be rather rich affected, then poore inamored. The Lady <hi>Lucretia Machiauella</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this excellent queſtion: whether is more feruent, the loue of a man towardes a woman, or of a woman towardes a man?</p>
            <p>Moſt gentle Lady aunſwered <hi>Guirino,</hi> the reaſons are not of ſmall moment, by which wee may conclude, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men exceede in loue, whereof the firſt is perfection, which women receiue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnition with man, as by the Philoſopher it is confirmed, where hee entreateth of vniuerſall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of things naturall: who deſirous to ſhewe the great deſire, the firſt matter hath of vnition with forme, ſayth, that ſhee deſireth forme, as the female deſireth the male: and this is in no other reſpect, but becauſe matter requireth perfection from forme, as doth the female from the male. Woman therefore attayning perfection from man, and not man from woman, ſo amorous deſire in her is more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent then that in man. But further, if wee ſhall but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the proper ſubiect and abode of loue, wee ſhall finde that it is in ſoft and delicate hearts, the which continually are nouriſhed with ſweete and pleaſing cogitations, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <hi>Petrarch</hi> heere teſtifieth, ſpeaking of loues originall, when he ſayth:
<q>
                  <l>From idle mind, and want onneſſe humane</l>
                  <l>He ſpringes: nouriſht with thoughts, though ſweet, yet vaine,</l>
                  <l>And of vaine folke, doth Lord and God remaine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Women therefore beeing naturally ſoft, delicate, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16643:36"/>idle, being nouriſhed with ſweete and pleaſant cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: and on the contrarie, men beeing ſterne, and for the moſt part, entangled in ſerious meditations, wee may conclude, that loue taking greater nouriſhment in the heart of a woman, becommeth alſo more preualent and vigorous. Although I, notwithſtanding theſe reaſons, do hold the contrarie for trueth, and that amorous paſsion is much more vehement in man then in woman: and I am mooued thereto by this moſt probable ſuppoſition, that the more preualent cauſe, bringeth foorth the more forcible effect. The beautie then of woman beeing farre more excellent then that of man, as Signior <hi>Patritio</hi> yeſter day ſhewed: and beauty being the cauſe which produceth loue, it will follow, that the beautie of a woman ſhall bring forth in mans heart amorous affection: much more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, then ſhall the beautie of a man, in the heart of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and therefore reaſon willeth, that the name of belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued be attributed to the woman, and the name of Louer to man, being proper to a woman (and reward of her beautie) to be belouèd and ſerued of man, mans property confiſting in louing and ſeruing her, as his naturall miſtreſſe. That this is true, experience teacheth, for a woman ſeldome pricked forwarde with a morous affection, is mooued to loue a man, or if ſhee loueth, ſhee doth it but to auoyde the vice of ingratitude, knowing her ſelfe to bee beloued, and faythfully ſerued.</p>
            <p>It is no maruaile then, if in the heart of a Woman, this fire beeing alwayes ſo ſlenderly kindled, it is in poſsibilitie by euerie blaſt of diſdaine, to bee extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and that ſhee is ſo apt to change, will, and minde. Anſweting therefore, vnto the contrary reaſons, and firſt to the authoritie of the Philoſopher, I ſay it is true, that the firſt matter deſireth forme as the female the male. For as the female, which in this reſpect repreſenteth Nature, deſireth the male, not for her owne perfection, becauſe ſhee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16643:37"/>is moſt perfect, but for the conſeruation of her proper kinde, and for generall perfection, ſo matter deſireth not forme for her perfection, becauſe ſhe in her owne eſſence is perfect inough: neither being matter, hath it neede of forme, but ſhe deſireth the vnion of forme, for generall perfection, to the end this compoſition might be made. To the other reaſon I anſwere, that the heart of women is farre more ſoft and delicate then is mans, and ſhee is idle, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſweete and pleaſant cogitations, but I denie theſe to be the principall harbourers of amorous paſsions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeede they bee eaſie and plaint ſubiects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion. For the tender and gentle heart of a woman not being able to endure the feruent ſighes, teares, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of her faythfull Louer, is procured to ſatisfie him with mutuall affection, by compaſsion rather ſubdued, then amorous paſsion.</p>
            <p>I doubt Signior <hi>Guirino,</hi> replyed the Lady <hi>Machiauella,</hi> that you haue rather procured your ſelfe diminution, then attribution of our fauour, your demerite deſeruing the one ſo much more aboue the bond wherein we are tyed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other, as the meaneſt blame you haue imputed vnto vs, exceedeth the vncertain commendation mixed therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: and truly this is a new kind of reprehenſion, when vnder praiſe lieth hidden deprauation: but who knoweth not that vnder commendation of our beauty, you haue priuily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the rebuke of tyranny? and by ſhewing how we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come louers by election, you hane made vs as it were altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rebellious to loue. But which is worſe, you haue deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vs for flitting &amp; inconſtant, which blame vndoubtedly doth ſo far excee de the prayſe of compaſsion, as the vice of infidelitie ſurmounteth the natural vertue of pietie: &amp; al is vntrue: for wee are not tyrannous, nor rebellious fro loue, but louing, more conſtant and faithfull then men. You Ladie, aunſwered <hi>Guirino,</hi> haue interpreted my wordes in ſiniſter ſence, for the commendation is true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to you, and the blame is vncertaine, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16643:37"/>not by your fault. I confeſſe, that vnder the name of your beauty I haue expreſſed tyranny, conforming my ſelfe with <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was wont to ſay (ſpeaking of humane beautie) that ſhe was a tyrant that raigned but a ſmal time. This moſt wiſe Philoſopher, deſirous to inferre, that beauty in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a tyrant, doth violently dououre and drawe vnto her ſelfe all thoſe mindes, which may comprehend her, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ouer them all, tyrannicall empire. Therefore you can not auoyde, but being faire, you muſt alſo be tyrants, neither can this be aſcribed vnto you for diſcommendation, ſeeing it is a particular priuilege granted vnto you from God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the end that by meane of loue, you might by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie by vs men, be loued and ſerued. This ſecret and naturall vice of tyranny which is in you, haue I yet after ſuch a ſort tempered with pietie, that it ſhoulde not ſeeme greeuous vnto you, to bee called Tyrants by nature, and gratious Queenes by election; neither haue I made you altogether rebellious to loue, though I haue attributed vnto you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the name of beloued than louing, hauing alſo ſhewed that it is greater perfection to be beloued, than loue: and notwithſtanding it is true that you are ready to change your will and minde, this is in you rather a vertue than vice, being a manifeſt ſigne, that amorous affection can not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile ſo farre with you, but iuſt diſdaine may much more, neyther doe you make your ſelues ſo ſeruile, but that ſtill you reſerue your princely authoritie, which neither can nor will ſupport the leaſt contempt: and your ſelfe (Ladie) giueth heere of ample teſtimony, who not for any offence, but vpon ſuſpition, that amongſt diuers praiſes of women, I had ſowed ſome little ſeede of blame, al angry on a ſodain, haue changed your minde and opinion towardes me, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me, not onely vnworthy of your owne fauour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the gracious reſpect of al theſe ladies: Notwithſtàding confident in my innocencie, and in their iuſt and mercifull authoritie, I liue in hope, that more than euer heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will grace me with their fauour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:16643:38"/>This playſted (anſwered the Lady <hi>Machiauella,</hi>) will not a whit mollifie the impoſtume of my iuſt wrath: for I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it is falſe, that wee women are tyrants or rebellious to Loue, beeing certaine, that in louing we are more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and conſtant then men, which you alſo would confeſſe, if you were not of a malignant minde: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fidelitie and conſtancye themſelues bee of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine, and not of the Maſculine gender. Al the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, ſmiled at this replication, and the Lady <hi>Victoria Bentiuoglia,</hi> whoſe beauty the Graces themſelues accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſaid.</p>
            <p>You Signior <hi>Guirino,</hi> haue beere by the authoritie of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch</hi> confirmed, that the louer transformeth him ſelfe into the beloued, of which I am verie doubtfull, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to imagine, what manner of transformation this ſhould bee, neither will I bee ſo fooliſh to beleeue that <hi>Petrarch</hi> after the manner of <hi>Daphne,</hi> transformed him ſelfe into <hi>Laura.</hi> I am deſirous therefore, that you would verifie vnto mee your ſaying, manifeſting vnto mee, howe it may bee that the louer ſhould bee transformed into the beloued. When <hi>Guirino</hi> aunſwered: your deſire is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (moſt gentle Ladie) wherein to ſatisfie you, it is neceſſarie that I diſcouer ſome ſecrets, which to the Philoſophers are onely knowne. You ſhall therefore vnderſtande, that we cannot perceiue before the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſence, bee firſt made like to the thing percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Which ſimilitude notwithſtanding, is neither reall nor materiall, but wee call it Spiritall and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall: as for example, I cannot perceiue or ſee your faire and gracious forme, if firſt mine eyes (the ſenſible inſtrument of ſight) doo not ſo draw it into it ſelfe, as that it becommeth like to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, you (faire Lady) beholding in mine eies, may ſee your goodly ſhape, as in a moſt cleare glaſſe: For betweene the glaſſe and the eye there is no further difference, but that the glaſſe is an eie without life, and the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16643:38"/>eye is a liuing glaſſe. Nowe this your beautifull Image, is tranſported, by meane of the moſt ſubtile vitall ſpirites, and imprinted in the inward organe, that is, the intrinſecate part of the braine, which alſo becommeth like vnto her, and from thence receiued into my ſoule, my ſoule her ſelfe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of you the whole ſimilitude, ſo that we may ſay, that while I ſee and behold youpreſent, my ſoule wholy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured into you, is no other but the true pourtraiture of your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This which by proofe is verified in exterior ſenſe, is alſo as true in ſenſe interiour, which is that vertue of the ſenſitiue facultie, called fantaſie, or imagination, which is of force to contemplate and perceiue obiectes, although they be abſent, by thoſe imaginations which remaine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the interior organ or member: whenſoeuer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſoule imagineth any thing, ſhe becommeth like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and further, ſpiritally transformeth her ſelfe into the thing imagined: the ſame that happeneth to ſenſe, falleth out likewiſe to vnderſtanding, vnderſtanding beeing in a manner altogether like to ſenſe: for while the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceiueth and beholdeth anything, it is transformed into it, and becommeth the ſame: and therefore happie are thoſe, who employ the beautifull gift of the minde, to contemplate diuine and high things; for in that ſtate, they become diumitie it ſelfe. By this which I haue expounded vnto you (moſt honorable Lady) you may eaſily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the transformation of the louer into the beloued. For it is not a reall, but a ſpiritall transformation: For the true louer bearing always the repreſentation of the beloued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his ſoule, and neuer ayming his thoughtes, but towardes his beloued obiect, in that ſtate hee commeth to bee transformed into it. Whereuppon the diuine Philoſopher in his <hi>Conuiuio,</hi> deſcribing the force of Loue, ſaith, that Loue, with ſuch a ſtrong knotte knitteth louers together, that of twoo hee maketh one alone, willing to inferre, that thoſe, who abſolutely giue themſelues ouer
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16643:39"/>in prey to amorous paſsions, are after ſuch a ſorte enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue on their louing cogitations, as it may be affirmed, that the ſoule diſioyned from the body, liueth in the beloued: &amp; therefore no meruaile, though the bodies of Louers depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vitall vigor, do conſume and languiſh: The which heere <hi>Petrarch</hi> auerreth of himſelfe, in theſe <hi>Terzetti</hi> of this Sonnet: At euery pace I turne my ſelfe about, ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>Sometimes amidſt my mournings ſad and dull,</l>
                  <l>A doubt ariſeth how theſe members can</l>
                  <l>Liue, ſo remote from ſpirite, wonderfull:</l>
                  <l>But anſwered Loue, remembreſt not thou, man,</l>
                  <l>That this is priuiledg'd to Louers art,</l>
                  <l>From other qualities humane, apart.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>With this anſwer the Ladies and Knights remained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſatisfied, who expected with great deſire to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this meruailous Metainorphoſis. And his Miſtris <hi>Lucretia Calcagnina,</hi> a Matron, adorned with all gentle fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, made her doubt in this ſorte. It happeneth oftentimes, that after a long and colde conuerſation bet wixt man and woman, in the ende either one with the other, or both of them are enflamed with loue reciprocall, the which as it is true, ſo bringeth it that into doubt by you ſpoken, that the Louer is preſently enamoured, as conformable beautie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth it ſelfe vnto him: for I would reaſon thus: either that the beautie ſo often contemplated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to the Louer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, or not, if it be conformable, wherefore doth it not in a moment cauſe loue? but if there be no ſuch conformity, how can it procure this after long time? cleare mee this doubt. When <hi>Guirino:</hi> Two manner of waies gratious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, may your doubt be reſolued. Firſt I alleadge, that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reſpects, how long ſoeuer their conuerſation be, it may happen, that to the Louer thoſe beauties may be concealed which were more apt to enamour him, ſeeing a fine foote, a beautifull leg, a faire arme, a quicke and liuely gate, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellencies of the body hitherto couered, &amp; ſudainly or by chance perceiued, may kindle amorous flames: I will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16643:39"/>alſo affirme, that not onely the ſingularities of body, but thoſe of the minde alſo, may procure loue: and becauſe theſe do not ſo ſodainely diſcouer themſelues, to the eye of the ſoule, which is the reaſonable part, and that by little and little, with long obſeruation ſeeth and beholdeth, therefore not ſo ſodainely, but after long conuerſation, they enſlame the louer, ſo ſoone as he knoweth them, and after he is enflamed, with that which before with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes he ſawe, and was not there with contented, then with delight he reioyceth and is glad: for as the beauty of the body is of force to conceale from the louer the defects of the minde, and to make them appeare leſſe waightie, ſo the perfections of the minde, after they haue with ſweete and honeſt contentment faſtned on the louer, are of vigor to tranſforme the deformities of the bodie beloued, and make it to the louer ſeeme beautifull, or at leaſt, not bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh.</p>
            <p>This aunſwer was taken for ſufficient, when the Ladie Counteſſe of <hi>Sala,</hi> I would willingly know ſayd ſhe, whether a louer at one time may loue two miſtreſſes: and this my queſtion ariſeth, in hauing ſeene diuers times by experience, that they are ſeldome louers, who are content with one loue alone. No ſeruant (moſt honourable Lady (anſwered <hi>Guiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>) can ſerue two Maſters, neither can one Louer at the ſame inſtant, ſerue more then one iniſtris, which by many reaſons is manifeſt: And firſt becauſe the beauty of two ſubiects is either equall, or elſe we diſcouer the difference of more or leſſe: If they be equall, neither of the one nor of the other can he become louing: for finally, loue being no other but deſire, and deſire of it ſelte being vndetermined, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that placed between two obiects, it ſhould be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the better, or the worſe, by the more beautifull, or more deformed, other wiſe it would be alwaies immoueable: and therefore <hi>Iohn Baccone</hi> a Philoſopher, and moſt learned diuine, was wont to ſay, that if the horſe were in away e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſtant from two barly fieldes of like goodneſſe, he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16643:40"/>ſhould be in danger to die for hunger, for his appetite would not be moued more to the one then to the other corne. Hee therefore, who were in the preſence of two women, equally faire, not being able to bend his deſire, mooued through knowledge of ſence, more to the one then the other, ſhould reſt immouable, and conſequently, would loue neither the one, nor the other: but if there were a difference of more &amp; leſſe, deſire inclining it ſelfe, would bee enflamed with the more beautifull, and the other ſhould take no place: but further, if the Louer transformeth himſelfe into the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as before wee ſaide, not being able to transforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into two, but into one ſubiect only, ſo ſhall he bee able to loue but one ſubiect alone: to conclude, as that which hath taken place within, is an impediment to the other, but exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, which would ſurpriſe him: ſo that obiect which ſhall haue taken the poſſesſion of the louers heart, will forbid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other that attempteth to pearce thereinto: the which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch</hi> ſheweth in diuers places, to be true in him ſelfe, and principally in the Sonnet:

            <p>Touching experience of thoſe louers, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with one loue alone, it is altogether falſe, becauſe they are no true Louers but treacherous rebels to loue, as thoſe, who caried away with a furious ſtorme of luſt, fancy rather beaſtiall, then humane loue. the anſwer pleaſed the Lady Counteſſe, and all the other Gentlewomen. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Syluia Villa,</hi> a yong damozel of moſt beautifull and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till preſence, ſeeing you conclude, ſaide ſhee, that a Louer cannot loue two Miſtreſſes, ſhew mee alſo if one beloued of two ſeuerall friends, to auoide ingratitude, ought to content both Louers with intercourſe of affection? From the former concluſion anſwered <hi>Guirino,</hi> proceedeth the abſolution of this preſent doubt. For the beloued, not being able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme correſpondencie in loue, except ſhe alſo become en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored, and it beeing in the Louers power to affect but one ſubiect, ſhee can loue and fauour but one alone; for doing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſhee ſhall not only, not auoyde the vice of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but defrauding the firſt louer, of his part in that whole, which is his in all reaſon, ſhalbe moſt vnthankfull. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Syluia</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended this anſwer, when Madam <hi>Anne Stroz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> a Matron, whoſe fauor is accompanied, with modeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fabilitie, propounded after this manner: Men inamored amongſt many wordes, which they vtter, intermixed with teares and ſighs, they are wont to their beloued, with oath to affirm, that they affect them aboue themſelues: on which wordes, hauing many times muſed, I euer found my ſelfe in greater doubt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, neither can I be reſolued whether
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16643:41"/>it may be true, that the Louers affection towardes his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, is greater, then to his owne ſelf. Tell me therefore <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Guirino</hi> your opinion. It is requiſite anſwered <hi>Guirino:</hi> before I reſolue you, that you moſt noble Lady be aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that doubt hath no place in the loue, whereof wee haue entreated, which is a deſire of vnion, and ſuppoſeth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the thing beloued, for with this loue towardes our ſelues we cannot be affected, notwitſtanding the fable of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> firſt becauſe vnion preſuppoſeth two at the leaſt, ſecondly becauſe of our ſelues wee can haue no want. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your demaund hath place in that loue, which we terme good will, which is no other, but a deſire of giuing, or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfection in ſome ſubiect; touching which wee haue to conſider, that all loues haue originall from the affection towardes our ſelues, the which is ſuch, and ſo great, that all things created contend euer to woorke in fauour of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and hee that ſhould further ſay, that the creator fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned the world for no other cauſe, but to pleaſe himſelfe, ſhould not ſpeak much amiſſe, which being true as it is, how vaine are the wordes of flattering louers, when they affirme that they loue their miſtreſſes better then themſelues: But becauſe there is no lie ſo great, as in it there may not appeare ſome ſhadow of truth, it may ſo happen, that the louer deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſome ſort of humane good more in his miſtreſſe, then in himſelfe, as riches, honour, and ſuch like, and in this ſence it may bee true, that he could wiſh better to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, then to himſelfe. But he deſireth ſuch good to pleaſe himſelfe, it cannot therefore be ſayd, that he loueth his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe better then himſelfe. But wee ſee by experience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> that ſome louers depriued of the hope of their beloued, haue alſo ſuffered the priuation of life, and wee reade that the faithfull wife of <hi>Ametus,</hi> refuſed not to offer her ſelfe to voluntarie death for the loue of her husband: which is a manifeſt ſigne, that the louer may affect his beloued aboue himſelfe. And if we may credit <hi>Petrarch,</hi> it may bee ſayde, that the louer may not onely loue his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16643:41"/>aboue him ſelfe, but hating himſelfe, may plant all his affection in her: as hee affirmeth of himſelfe in the ſonnet,
<q>
                  <l>I finde no peace: <hi>ſaying:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>My ſelfe I hate, and loue an other beſt.</l>
               </q> Be aſſured (noble Lady) anſwered <hi>Guirino,</hi> that violent killers of themſelues, do that for no other end, but in a loue to their own perſons, and to pleaſe themſelues, being of opinion, that death ſhuld be to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as an eaſe, of ſome inſupportible griefe: and the wife of <hi>Ametus</hi> (ſuppoſing the fable to be true) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt perfourmed that louing offer, in fauour of her ſelfe, either as deſirous of glorie, or to auoide the ſorrowe which by the death of her husband, ſhe thought in her ſelfe inſupportable: neither want there examples of men moſt ſtudious of glorie, who to acquire immortall fame vnto themſelues, haue embraced voluntarie death as we reade of <hi>Curtius,</hi> of the <hi>Decij,</hi> of <hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> and other noble Romaines, whoſe attempts out of doubt were vndertaken, more for their own contentment, then for loue of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. So that I thinke there is not ſo ſimple a woman, which beleeueth ſuch vaine wordes, produced by Louers for their owne contentment, and by ſuch like disſimulations, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reciprocall affection, from their affected. This opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Guirino</hi> was by the gentlewomen approued true, not without ſome ſecret heart-burning of the gentlemen ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored: and neuer a gentlewoman remaining to propound any more queſtions, the Queene ſpoke after this ſorte: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh doubt is litle befitting princely Maieſtie, being a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſigne of ignorance, the which of all other defects in Princes is moſt reprochfull, ouercome notwithſtanding with a naturall deſire of vnderſtanding, I deſire it may bee lawful for me, <hi>Signior Guirino</hi> to demand of you, if in the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer not beloued, loue can long time indure. To doubt ſaide <hi>Guirino,</hi> moſt renowmed Queene; proceedeth rather from equalitie of contrarie reaſon, then from ignorance: &amp; to be circumſpectly doubtfull, may rather bee aſcribed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, then want of knowledge: Your highnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16643:42"/>in doubting, hath not only, not offended royall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, but by mouing a moſt excellent queſtion, hath giuen triall of your noble conceit, and by fauouring me, exerciſed your high and magnificent curteſie. Therefore before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your Maieſtie, I will declare the fable recited by moſt ſingular <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> in his ſixt oration. The goddeſſe <hi>Themis,</hi> ſaith he, being before <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus,</hi> who had brought forth <hi>Cupide,</hi> hauing highly commended the beauty of that winged child, added: ſincere loue may well be borne, but that he ſhould grow by himſelfe alone, vnderſtand O <hi>Venus,</hi> it can no wayes be: Therefore if you deſire that this your deare ſonne, may encreaſe to his proportionable greatneſſe, beget and bring forth another like to him, for ſuch will the nature of theſe two brothers bee, that in beholding one another, both of them will grow alike, and looke how much ſhal diminiſh in one, no leſſe will there impaire in the other. <hi>Venus</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this moſt wiſe goddeſſe, produced <hi>Anterota Cupides</hi> lawfull brother. By this fable wee may eaſily comprehend, that loue alone cannot endure in the louers heart, and for his maintainance and reduction, to his due ſtature, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, be beholde, and ſport with his brother <hi>Anterota.</hi> Yet, Signior <hi>Guirino,</hi> experience teacheth the contrarie, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Queene: for euery day, we ſee diuers enamored, without hauing the leaſt ſigne of interchaungeable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, obſtinate altogether in amorous enterpriſe, &amp; peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture confident in the ſaying of <hi>Dant</hi> before repeated:
<q>By loue, beloued, cake, from loue, are not exempt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Petrarch</hi> himſelfe, though his <hi>Lauretta</hi> were froward and ingrate vnto him, notwithſtanding as an obſtinate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, burſt forth into theſe verſes.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Yet liue I ſtill in hope, remembring this alwayes,</l>
               <l>That moistned drops, at length, though with ſome long delaies,</l>
               <l>In tract of time do pearce, the free, and marble ſtone.</l>
               <l>And heart ſo hard none is, which will not ſtraight way mone,</l>

               <l>Nor will ſo freezing colde, 'which heates not by the ſame.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There be two ſortes of Louers not beloued againe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Guirino,</hi> the one finding alwaies in his Miſtris, a pride correſpondent to her beautie, without receiuing at any time the leaſt ſigne of loue, but euer diſcouering in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, a duskiſh cloude of diſdaine, he moſt vnhappily lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. In the heart of ſuch a Louer (moſt renowned Queene) affection cannot continue, but giuing place to wrath, anger, and diſdaine, flying away, it departeth, being vnpoſsible, that it alone ſhould wreſtle long with reaſon, accompanied by theſe other moſt forcible affections. The other ſorte, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brow of their deare beloued, ſometimes faire, and ſometimes cloudie, the Louer doubtfull within himſelfe, &amp; feeding vppon a ſweet aire of hope, affecting, ſeruing, and entreating, maintaineth himſelfe long time. Such a Louer was <hi>Petrarch,</hi> as he deſcribeth himſelfe in the verſes recited to your highnes, and in other ſongs and ſonnets, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the ſonnet:
<q>
                  <l>I finde no peace: <hi>ſaying:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Priſoner I am, to ſuch an one, as neither opes nor ſhuts:</l>
                  <l>Nor holdes me faſt, nor yet the ſnare, with loues requitall cuts.</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guirinos</hi> anſwere was of the Queene accepted, and by the ſtanders by approoued for good, it ſeeming to all impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that where hope cannot bee ſetled, loue ſhould there make any long reſidence: and with this ending the diſcourſe of loue, the Queene commanded that they would practiſe ſome pleaſant conceits of diuination and fortune-telling, as amongſt women they vſe to do: and while they were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue on this paſtime, the Duke, and Lady Ducheſſe, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entring into the pallace, they ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly cauſed to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chamber, where this noble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany were aſſembled a Doe, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quicke in the nets, which hopping here &amp; there,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16643:43"/>leapt vppon the Gentlewomen. Whereuppon verie fearefull of this terrible creature, each one without tarrying for another, ranne all out into the great Hall, whome the excellent Ducheſſe meeting, with the other beautifull Huntreſſes, in a ſodain their feare was turned into laughter: and after a while, the huntſmen arriuing with a mightie winde of hornes, and crie of dogges, his highneſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the chaſe ſhould be brought into the hall, which being doone, there were many boares layed out, whereof ſome were ſo great, that the women durſt not beholde them. The reſt of the day was ſpent in diſcourſing vppon ſuch accidents as fell out in their Game, the gentlewomen taking no leſſe contentment to heare of that, then did the Hunters in recounting their owne exployts, in encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring and killing theſe terrible beaſtes. Euening beeing come, his highneſſe cauſed a moſt pleaſant Comedie to bee recited by the <hi>Geloſi.</hi> Theſe bee certaine Coemedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who requeſted euerie yeare by his highneſſe, are wont to come in the end of Autumne, and hee taketh them along to the ſea ſide, as alſo the whole Carneuale or Shroue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, to their great gaine, and contentment of all the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they employ themſelues in Commicall repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and are verie apte in imitating all manner of perſons and actions humane, but eſpecially thoſe, which are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to procure laughter, in which poynte they are ſo prompt and excellent, that they would make <hi>Heraclitus</hi> himſelfe to laugh. The Comedie ended, they practiſed certaine paſtimes, and beeing late, his highneſſe roſe vp, and each one departed to their ſeuerall lodgings. The day following was paſſed ouer by his highneſſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſant and delightſome chaſe, in which they killed Harts, and wilde Goats, with other beaſtes, to the ſingular contentation of the Ladies and Gentlewomen which were preſent. At the ſelfe ſame time, the vſuall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie beeing retired into the accuſtomed roome, the Ladie <hi>Camilla Coſtabili,</hi> was by chance, drawen Queene, a Matrone

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Moſt not able and eminent ſubiect, doth our Queene this day propound to be entreated of, which is Honor, it being with humane life in ſuch ſort connexed, that there is not any condition or qualitie of men, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knowledge of honor is not commodious: but aboue all others, it is ſo neceſſarie in a man noble and ciuill, as without it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerſhadowed, as it were with the obſcure darkeneſſe of ignorance, for the moſt part, in ſteede of honour, hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth infamie. This is that ardent heate which enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the minde of man, to glorious enterpriſes making him audacious againſt enemies, and to vices timerous. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phedro,</hi> compareth the minde of a man to a Chariot, whereof reaſon is the coach man, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind the horſes, &amp; deſire of honor the whip: The diuine Philoſopher minding to inferre, that reaſon without honourable deſire, and feare without reproch, are notable to bridle the moſt fierce paſsion, of the angry and concupiſcent faculties, and to direct man to vertue. I will therefore ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour my ſelfe, moſt famous Queene, to diſcourſe of Honor, ſeeing your highneſſe ſo commaundeth me, although to my ſelf I am not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that ſo high &amp; excellent a ſubiect, very
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16643:44"/>farre exceedeth the power of my wit, hoping theſe valorous knights, moſt faithfull ſubiects to Honour, will be readie to ſupply my defects. Honour (excellent Queene) being aboue meaſure deſired by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is a thing manifeſt, that in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of humane goods, ſome be appertaining to the body, as beautie, health, ſtrength, agilitie; and ſome to the minde, as vnderſtanding, wiſedome, knowledge, prudence, and arte, as alſo other goods there be externall belonging to fortune. Amidſt theſe therefore, Honour, out of doubt, cannot bee numbred amongſt thoſe goods, that appertaine to the bodie or mind, but rather is accounted amongſt them, in our ſelues not reſident; as are likewiſe riches, principalitie, power, friendes, a faire and modeſt wife, children, nobility, and ſuch like. Vniuerſally therefore wee will affirme, that honour is the moſt precious of all goods externall. But becauſe this word Honor ſignifieth not one alone, but two honors of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers nature in themſelues, not beeing able to aſsigne ſuch a definition, as wherein both may bee comprehended. I will diuide them; and one (as a new forger of theſe words) I will tearme naturall and imperfect; the other acquired honour, and perfect. By not conceiuing that honors are of two kinds, &amp; diuers of themſelues, &amp; not one, al they which hitherto haue entreated of Honour, haue fallen into moſt manifeſt errors: and amongſt other, the learned Biſhop of <hi>Caſerta,</hi> (prouided, if it bee true, that the booke of Honour, ſet forth vnder the name of <hi>Poſſeuiuo,</hi> were by him made, as of himſelfe he affirmeth) is led into a moſt notable errour; For he in the ſame booke hauing defined honour, &amp; wrong interpreted the fence of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his book of Rhetorike, after a long diſcourſe, vpon the ſame, he groundeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; not obſeruing, that combate is wholly contrarie to the nature of that honor by him diſcuſſed and defined. At this time therefore, I not ſwaruing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the order of nature, which is to go from the imperfect to the perfect, wil firſt intreat of honor naturall, and conclude in honor acquired: which is one of the principall circumſtances of humane felicity. I ſay ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16643:45"/>that honor naturall, is a common opinion, that he hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hath neuer failed in iuſtice, nor valor. I term it honor na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural, becauſe man bringeth it from his mothers wombe, and preſerueth it vnſpotted, except through ſome greeuous offence or ſuſpition, he looſe this good opinion. This was defined by <hi>Fausto Longiano</hi> in his Combate, to bee no other than an incorruptible ſtate of Nature, as though to poſſeſſe this honor, it were ſufficient to maintaine our ſelues, ſuch as wee were borne. This is that honour (moſt excellent Queene) whereof there is ſo great fame, and wherein there is not any one, which profeſſeth not himſelfe to haue his part, as ſurely hee hath, though in no other reſpect, at loaſt yet in his mouth, in that hee will neyther ſay nor doe anye thing wythout the licence of honour, or except honour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. This is that which giueth occaſion euery day, of bralles, hatred, and rancours: and vppon which was grounded, in times paſt, wicked combate. I affirmed it to be an opinion, and not a ſcience or knowledge: For ſcience is grounded on trueth and neceſsity: Opinion vpon probability and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, For we may well haue an opinion, that one is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, but wee cannot affirme it, wythout vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much, becauſe externally he may be good, and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, wicked.</p>
            <p>This opinion which is termed honour, is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a ſecret ſuppoſition, that man is good, if there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare nothing to the contrary; and notwythſtanding this hath in it difficulty; eſpecially for that which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſayth, in the ſecond of his Ethickes, that vertues and vices in a man, are neither naturall, nor againſt nature, and that good and wicked habite, not by nature, but by cuſtom is acquired: notwythſtanding by that which hee addeth in his ſixt Booke, it ſeemeth this ſuppoſition may be graunted, becauſe he affirmeth that man is borne with a certaine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by meane of which, he ſeemeth apt to iuſtice, fortitude, and temperance, ſeeing in a man, by vertue of his mind, there are naturally ſome principall notes, by which we may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16643:45"/>preſume, that hee is rather good, then wicked: and I haue ſet downe theſe two parcels, that haue not failed in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice nor valor, differing from other defects, for that God onely being immaculate and without fault, it is neceſſarie that man, accompanied with ſome imperfection, muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, notwithſtanding thoſe ſinnes are tollerable, which ſometimes through humane fragilitie wee cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and therefore the Philoſopher in the ſeconde of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thikes ſayth, that he cannot be termed vicious and wicked, which a little ſwarueth from comlineſſe and honeſtie, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to infer, that thoſe ſinnes, although they giue teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie after a certaine manner, that wee haue not performed vertuous habite, yet are they not ſufficient to make him looſe his honour, but rather thoſe, which are committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt iuſtice and fortitude. And that euerie one may the better vnderſtand how honour is preſerued and loſt, I haue not thought it much from the purpoſe to declare, what it is to faile in Iuſtice, and what in Honour. To faile in Iuſtice therefore, is no other but to performe the things, which by good lawes are forbidden, and ſeuerely puniſhed, to iniurie another againſt reaſon, and by ſiniſter meanes, raſhly to commit manſlaughter, murther, theft, 'rapines, treaſons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, and ſinne againſt nature, to be an heretike, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing ſiniſterly of God and diuine things, to practiſe vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to bee addicted vnto vnlawfull gaine: to bee a falfe witneſſe, to the preiudice of the goods, life, or honor of another: finally, he is ſayd to haue failed in Iuſtice, who hath extremely offended againſt any vertue, ſeeing that of Iuſtice vniuerſally all things depende. To want va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is no other, but baſely to carrie our ſelues in daungers, as that ſhould bee, to abandon the colours, or battaile, by flying away, or elſe to leaue our friend and companion in daunger, not to hazard our liues for defence of religion, and of holy Chriſtian Church, for his prince, for his countrie, for father, wife, children, and ſuch like: as alſo hee manifeſteth vilitie, who eaſily ſwalloweth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16643:46"/>without by his owne proper valour, ſhewing himſelfe therewith mooued. And let this by mee ſpoken, ſuffice, to make knowne the nature of this honour: the which true lie may be termed imperfect Honour, in compariſon of that by proper valour acquired. This Honour principally is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to beneficence (vnderſtanding this word not onely for bountie or liberality, as many times wee doe, but as beeing derined of the Latine woords <hi>bene</hi> and <hi>facio,</hi> to doo well or good) it being the moſt excellent of all other vertuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And it is by the Philoſopher, two manner of wayes defined, in the firſt booke of his Rhetorike, ſaying: Honor is a ſigne of beneficent opinion: and in the fourth of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thikes, Honour is the reward of vertue: the firſt definition hath reſpect rather to the honourer, then to the honoured, becauſe it is a ſigne of opinion which the honourer hath, of the beneficent inclination of him honoured. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond rather concerneth him honoured, then the honourer, in that it is a rewarde of vertue, which in him honoured is founde. Going about therefore to deſcribe the Nature of this Honour, called by me Honour acquired, I will affirme, accepting both the one &amp; the other of theſe definitious, that acquired honour is no other, then a reward, manifeſting an action of beneficence, there being no action ſo famous, nor that maketh man more like to god, then to be beneficial, the which the ancients plainly ſhew, who eſteemed their great benefactors worthy to be put into the number of the gods, conſecrating vnto them temples, dedicating altares, erecting Statues, offering ſacrifices, and ſuch like honours, neither was <hi>Iupiter</hi> called by the Latines, the cheefe of the Gods for any other occaſion, but becauſe adminiſtring all things, he is the head Benefactour, as for the like reaſon by the Graecians hee was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as it were <hi>Zon,</hi> which is as much to ſay as life, being he that giueth and preſerueth life in al things of the world. But becauſe this rewarde, which manifeſteth action of beneficence, may be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more waies then one, the Philoſopher in the firſt of his Rhetorike
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16643:46"/>diuideth this honour into diuers parts, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I comprehend vnder theſe two heades: conſidering that of honours, ſome be permanent, and others not. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent we call thoſe, which after wee haue giuen them, remaine to the perpetuall honour of him honoured, as Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Images, Temples, Altars, Sepulchers, Crownes, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtipendes, hymnes and ſuch like which cauſe, not only men to bee honoured, but alſo make them glorious, and are neuer attributed but to gods, and to men heroycall, who haue perfourmed great and publike benefites.</p>
            <p>Honours not permanent, we tearme them, which after their performing, remaine not in action: and theſe by the Philoſopher, are called, barbarous cuſtomes, and by vs much frequented, as to giue the place, to bow, to kiſſe the hand, the hemme of the veſture, the knee, the foote, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the hat, and ſuch like: and theſe honours are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done to them, who haue bin beneficiall, but alſo to thoſe, who either for their riches or vertue, are of power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite. Out of the definitions by me ſet downe, as alſo from that, we haue hetherto diſcourſed, it may eaſily be diſcerned, how different one honour, is from another; in that natural honour, may rather be ſaide to bee, a former diſpoſition of true honour, that by valor is acquired, then honour abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and perfect: and therefore it hath the ſelfe ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, to true honour, as the facultie vegetatiue, hath with the ſenſatiue: for as vegetation may from ſence bee ſeperate, and is of it ſelfe apt to bring foorth, one ſorte of liuing creatures, as bee plants and fruites; ſo this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may ſtand, nay and for the moſt part is from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeperate; and yet be ſufficient of it ſelfe to forme, an vnperfect ſorte of men honoured, conſidering all thoſe, who are iudged, not to haue failed in Iuſtice and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, are called honourable: And as in the liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the vertue vegetall, is firſt in nature and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the ſenſatiue, being as it were a former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition vnto ſence, ſo this honour, preceedeth euer, honor
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16643:47"/>perfect, being vnto it a former diſpoſition. And as the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue facultie without the vegetatiue can not ſtand, ſo can there not be honour acquired, where there is not honor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, conceiuing that he which is reputed a wicked man, is of any honor vnworthy. But moreouer, its a thing manifeſt, that this honor wheere of euery one maketh profeſsion, is without labor acquired, in that man bringeth it from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb; but true honor is obtained, by excellent ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and induſtrie, and by the ſelfe ſame means is preſerued. Of honour naturall, it being grounded vppon contingent, as wel the bad as good may thereof be partakers. Of honor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, it being a manifeſt ſigne, and reward of vertue &amp; her operations, only the man vertuous and excellent, is there of poſſeſſor. Naturall honor conſiſteth not in any exterior act, becauſe in this the honorer performeth not, and the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red receiueth nothing: but perfect &amp; true honor is knowne by exterior action; by reaſon in this the honorer, by reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, giueth ſome ſigne thereof, as alſo the honoured, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it: moreouer, honor naturally hath his contrary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue, which is infamy: and, honor acquired, his contrary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue. And, to the end your Maieſtie may vnderſtand theſe philoſophical termes, you ſhal be aduertiſed, that contraries poſitiue, be thoſe, which haue both their reall beeing in the nature of things; but of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traries priuatiue, the one hath his reall being, and the other hath no exiſtence at all, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſake: heat and cold, are contraries poſitiue, becauſe in that ſubiect which is not hote, there is alwayes found colde; and where no colde is, heat hath there his reall being. Light and darkeneſſe be contraries priuatiue, becauſe light onely hath his reall being, but darknes hath nothing in exiſtence, as that which is no other, but the bare effence of light. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore honor naturall hath poſitiue contrary; for where hee is not, there is reall infamy: but honor, which is the reward of beneficence, hath his priuatiue; for where he appeareth not, yet infamy doth not there take place, or diſhonor, but only his prination or abſence. For one that hath neuer a ſtatue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16643:47"/>to him, nor crowne giuen him, publike gifts, or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie, to whom no preeminence is giuen, or cappe moued, neither is by any ſuch like obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s honored, ſhal not, for all this remayne infamous or diſhonored, nor in queſtion of honor can not be excepted againſt, but we will ſay, that he is only depriued of that honor which is the reward of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, this being a part of humane felicitie. This is as much as I can or am able to deliuer (renowmed Queene) vpon this ſubiect of honor, wherein, if I haue bin deficient, let theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honorable Knights pleade for me.</p>
            <p>Stay a little Signior <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> anſwered the Queene, for ther is a skirmiſh prepared againſt you, wherin it ſhal great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help you, to be a good and well trained ſouldier. Then ſhe commanded al thoſe gentlmen, who were there preſent, that they would moue doubts, &amp; contradict <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of honor, after the ſame methode, as the Gentle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had done in the diſcuſsion of loue; and the Gentlemen beholding one an other with ſilence, as they who ſitting round about, knew not from whome the beginning was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, the Queene ſmiling vppon the illuſtrous Lord <hi>Don Ceſared Eſte,</hi> (who vnderſtanding of the excellent diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that paſſed in the chamber of the Counteſſe, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe cloſely from the chaſe, was come in all haſte with the Lord Marqueſſe, to finde out the company) made a ſigne vnto him, that he ſhould mooue his doubt; and his moſt honorable Signiory, in whom, in his greene yeeres, a moſt bright beame of heroicall vertue doth ſhine, gratiouſly obeying the commaundement of the Queene, beganne in this maner.</p>
            <p>You (O Knights) if I doe carry well in minde, haue grounded this opinion, which is termed Honour, vppon a ſecret ſuppoſition, that a man, if there appeare nothing to the contrary, is good. Which ſuppoſition I holde to bee very doubtfull: yea and further, that ſome notable ſigne of vertue not appearing, hee may bee coniectured rather a wicked than good man: conſidering that humane nature
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16643:48"/>of it ſelfe, enclineth rather to vice than vertue. Which by this may be imagined, becauſe the way of vertue is aſprous, hard, and laborſom; ſo that as a thing myraculous, men point at him who arriueth to the end, and becommeth perfectly vertuous: and on the contrary, the way that conducteth to vice, is ſo eaſie, plaine, and pleaſant, as the number of them is infinite which walke by it, and become vitious; this being a manifeſt ſigne, that naturally we are not enclined to vertue, but to vice: becauſe things difficult, and that ſeldome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, are farre from the condition of nature. Experience furthermore ſheweth, that wee rather encline to vice than vertue, in that there is none of vs (for what preuayleth it to lie) which in himſelfe hath not triall, with howe great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence he is drawne to vice, and howe hardly hee abſtaineth from ſenſible contentments, how troubleſome continence is vnto him, and patience bitter. Which being (as it is) true, ſo ſhall your ſuppoſition be falſe: for as all things hauing no impediment, do rather worke according to their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than againſt their nature, ſo muſt we preſume not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other, that man for the moſt part, is rather wicked, than good: the which is confirmed, by the anſwer of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> who being demaunded, what was moſt true, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that men are wicked. The ſuppoſition therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe, ſo ſhall the opinion of an others valour, and iuſtice be vntrue; for the foundation failing, the building falleth downe; Notwithſtanding I attend your anſwere. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of your renowmed Segniory, anſwered <hi>Gualenguo,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced againſt my ſuppoſition and opinion, are ſo preua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as I may wel ſay the concluſion pleaſeth me not a whit; for I know not well how to anſwer the argument: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our naturall fragillitie is ſuch, as that it neuer ceaſeth to make triall of occaſion while it be brought in ſubiection vnto vice, neyther could diuine <hi>Paul</hi> effect, although he were diuinely illumined, but that he was driuen to ſay, I perceiue in my members, and fleſh, an other lawe, repugnant to the lawe of my minde, which ſubdueth mee to the lawe of ſin:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16643:48"/>Yet, notwithſtanding all this, I am of opinion, that my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is true, as alſo that man in his naturall eſtate, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to vertue, and not to vice, being good and not wicked: the which I hope with ſo liuely reaſons to make manifeſt, as euery one ſhall bee out of doubt. I ſay therefore, that all things comprehended in this vniuerſall frame, hauing their originall from God, as God is chiefe bountie and goodnes, ſo are all theſe partakers of this bountie, and therefore al are good in the firſt inſtant of nature. To affirme therefore, that man is wicked by nature, is no other but to auerre, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the creatures of the whole worlde, the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble image of the inſenſible God (for ſo is man) is wicked: a matter repugnant to trueth, and the authoritie, as wel of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuines, as philoſophers, who are of opinion, that in this inferior world, amongſt all liuing creatures, only man may be vertuous and happy; and as fire ſhould not be light, if of his nature he did incline to the centre, ſo a man ſhould ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be vertuous nor good, if naturally hee were inclined to vice. Furthermore, if Nature, the miniſtreſſe of God, dooth not onely generate, but guideth al things generated to their end, and therefore heauy things deſcend, and thoſe light aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, as alſo beaſts and liuing creatures, ſo ſoone as they are generate, by nature herſelfe, they are directed to their end &amp; perfection: how can it be, that man ſhould only reſt by her abandoned; and which is worſe, not onely abandoned and contemned, but further inſtigated, to his ruine and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Man by the beautiful gift of the mind is true man, who as he is diuine, ſo will wee affirme with the Poet, that;
<q>Like to his Maker he, doth heauenly ſtate retaine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore hee deſireth that onely which is beſt and diuine, neyther can hee, knowing the true and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall good, wiſh euill: by which reaſon the diuine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher beeing mooued, ſubſcribed to the opinion of the Stoickes, affirming in all his concluſions, that man is by nature good, and againſt nature wicked, and that hee as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16643:49"/>all other things is inclined to this end which is beſt: and the Philoſopher ſayth, that man is neuer wicked, but when he is affected againſt Nature, which commeth to paſſe, when in himſelfe hee hath not ciuill gouernment, and that which ſhould obey, commaundeth: which is ſence, ouer reaſon. If wee ſhall alſo further conſider, that man naturally is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after knowledge, as the Philoſopher affirmeth in the Proemium of his diuine Philoſophie, wee may eaſily iudge, that to vertue and not vice, hee is naturally diſpoſed: for of vice there can be no ſcience, it being nothing in exiſtance, but otherwiſe a meere priuation, as affirmeth great <hi>Dioniſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in the booke of Diuine Titles, and likewiſe the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mikes, and Peripatetickes. If we therefore (moſt famous Lord) haue reſpect to the Creator of man, hee is his owne Image, if to the gift of Nature, he is moſt apt, if to the end of euerie thing created, man amongſt mortall creatures is onely capable of cheefe good, hauing onely the vſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and good conſultation to him alone is proper: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore notwithſtanding the reaſous by your Segniory all ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the contrarie, wee muſt conclude, that naturally he is enclined to vertue, and not to vice: and that it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that he is good, and not wicked. To which reaſons, I being to make anſwer, we muſt conſider, that in man three natures are comprehended, one common to al liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is vegetable: another common to creatures and man, and that is ſence: the third common to man and things Diuine, and this is reaſonable Nature. By the firſt, man is like to plants, by the ſecond, to other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, by the thrid, he commeth to be true man, and a diuine creature, and therefore man by participation, is in the midſt betwixt mortall and diuine: for in reſpect of body and ſence, he partaketh of mortalitie, but touching his mind he is diuine and immortal: as in man theſe three natures are diſcouered, ſo finde we in him likewiſe, three natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; one called properly naturall, and dependeth on the vnſatiable knowledge of vniuerſall nature, which mooueth
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16643:49"/>all things depriued of knowledge, to thoſe operations, that may conduct them to their proper ends; and therefore this is not ſubiect to the internall vnderſtanding of man, that is, to ſence, and the mind, becauſe ſhe gouerneth, augmenteth, nouriſheth, mooueth the pulſes, the ſpirits, the hearts: and performeth ſuch other like offices, without the conſent of reaſon and wil: the ſecond is called liuing Inclination, which is deriued from the knowledge of ſence, and in a man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſubiect to reaſon: the third is reaſonable Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and taketh his originall from the knowledge of the minde: this in true man, naturally commaundeth ouer the inclination of ſence.</p>
            <p>Theſe foundations beeing firme and reall, I gather twoo concluſions: the firſt, that man in the incorruptible ſtate of his owne nature, is alwaies enclined to vertue, abhorring vice, following honeſt contentment, and auoydeth that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt: the ſecond is this, that man, as he is a creature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with matter and ſence, enclineth naturally to ſenſible contentments, and to vice accidentally: the firſt concluſion is cleare, by that which I haue before ſpoken. For man, produced from God, cannot bee but like to his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; conceiuing by his proper nature, that honeſt good is the true and chiefeſt good, which conſiſteth in vertuous action, it is not poſsible that naturally he ſhuld will his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. The ſeconde is manifeſt by this: for anie man, how wicked ſoeuer, neuer doth euill in fauour of vice, but of contentment: the theefe therefore ſteales not to bee a theefe, but to poſſeſſe and enioy that whereof hee hath want, and the adulterer committeth not adulterie, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an adulterer, but this hee doth in fauour of luſt, and venerous contentment, the which contentment if hee could attaine vnto without vice, it would be much more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſing vnto him: for if a man ſhould take contentment in vice, and not in vertue, true man ſhould not taſte in himſelfe, the incredible contentation of vertuous action; which queſtionleſſe is ſuch, as maketh him bleſſed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16643:50"/>and happie. Neither ſhould the miſerable man bee ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by his owne conſcience, the which without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe, bringeth vnto him moſt grieuous puniſhment. Man therefore runneth into vice accidentally, that is, by how much the more the vice is conioyned with exceſſe of pleaſure or griefe. That vice is contrarie to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination of man, it may be this reaſon bee prooued, becauſe before the vice of intemperance, proceedeth that ſame ſemy-vice of incontinence, which is no other but a precedent battaile, that externall maketh with internall Man, beſtiall with reaſonable Nature: and except reaſon be made drunke, and ſubdued by ſence, man falleth not into vice. This battaile out of queſtion, ſhould haue no place, if a man were naturally inclined to vice, for where there is naturall inclination, there can neither be fight nor reſiſtance: and if any ſhould obiect, that by the ſemi-vertue of continence, which preceedeth temperance, the contrarie may bee concluded: I anſwer, that in this there is ſpeciall difference, becauſe the incontinent after vitious action, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth himſelfe, and is daunted in minde, but the man continent after vertuous action, is merrie, and comforted: the one is toſſed with trouble ſome thoughts: the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelfe with all quiet and tranquilitie, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then doth the earth, when after great violence, in the end ſhee vniteth her ſelfe to the Center, whether ſhee enclineth.</p>
            <p>But moreouer, man more then of any other outwarde good, is deſirous of honor, prayſe, &amp; glorie, he ſhunneth and abhorreth more then any other euill, diſhonour, and infamie: acquiring therefore vnto himſelfe, honour and prayſe, by meane of vertue, but infamie and diſhonour, by meane of vice: it is neceſſary, that man naturally ſhuld bend to vertue, and contemne vice: for it would be inconuenient to loue the effect, and hate the cauſe. But notwithſtanding all this, it cannot bee denied, but the number of vitious, is infinite: and contrariwiſe of vertuous, the number to be ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16643:50"/>ſmall, that good <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſeeking with a light in the day time amongſt a multitude, could not find one: this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from no other, but becauſe the way vnto vice is eaſie, and that vnto vertue hard and difficult. Of which, if we be deſirous to ſearch out the reaſon, wee muſt diſcouer a little further, and conſider what maner of thing vertue is, as what is vice, and howe it may be ſayde, that both the one and other habite is acquired. I ſay then, that vertue is no other, but an habite, imprinted in the ſenſible facultie by true and direct reaſon: by meane of which, that facultie ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily yeelding to reaſon, reduceth all his affections to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocritie, and is conuerſant either about pleaſure or griefe: and vice is an habite imprinted in ſence, by perueiſe reaſon, by whoſe meanes, declining from right and direct reaſon, it eaſily burſteth forth into heigth, &amp; exceſſe of pleaſure and griefe.</p>
            <p>Although man (as I haue ſhewed) bee naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to vertue, yet is he neither vertuous nor vitious by Nature, as wee haue ſaid, but acquireth both the one and the other habite, by cuſtome that is with frequent, and like rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated actions. Furthermore, we muſt obſerue, that man is neither capable of vice nor vertue, before he be a perfect cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature &amp; perfect man: vnto which perfection hee arriueth in the beginning of the fifteenth yeare of his age, for then hee is a perfect creature, beeing able to generate another like himſelfe, and is perfect man, hauing the true vſe of reaſon: but while that time, he liueth rather the life of euerie liuing creature, then of man, performing no one action with pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, but ouer-guided with pleaſure or anger, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in that ſtate, he cannot be either vitious or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo hee is not then woorthie of puniſhment, rewarde, praiſe, or reproach. Man therefore liuing firſt an irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, before a reaſonable life, and aiming all his operations, to the contentment of ſence, this by little and little, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in him a former diſpoſition to vice, and contrary to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſo that wee may ſay with the Poet:
<q>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:16643:51"/>
                  <l>From whence it ſure proceedes, that nature quite doth ſwarue,</l>
                  <l>From proper courſe, the lawes of cuſtome to obſarue.</l>
               </q> Whereupon, being neceſſarie for introducing vertuous ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, to take away firſt wicked impreſsion, and tame ſence by little and little, which after the manner of an vntamed and euill cuſtomed Colt, neuer ceaſing to ſpurne againſt reaſon: therefore the way of vertue is hard and vneaſie, whereas contrariwiſe, that of vice is pleaſing and readie. This other difficulty alſo offereth it ſelfe, that vertue is in the meane, and vice is that which mooueth it ſelfe from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocritie: one way onely directeth to vertue, but thoſe that conduct to vice, are infinite, which is plainely ſhewed by the example of the Archer, for hee can hitte the white but one way only, but to miſſe it, there be waies infinite. Finally, from the ſmall number of vertues, wee may aſsigne this reaſon: for as to exerciſe and performe a vitious habite, few things ſuffice, ſo to acquire and practiſe vertue, there bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtruments, and circumſtances neceſſarie. And firſt, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall birth, and good temperature of the bodie, is not of ſmall importance: for vnderſtanding not beeing able to worke, except ſtirred vppe by ſence, as alſo ſence cannot performe his dutie, if the members and body bee not well diſpoſed, as good temperance aideth the ſences, ſo doth it helpe vnderſtanding: and from hence commeth it, that one man more then another, as the Philoſopher affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, ſeemeth borne to temperaunce, inſtice, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: further then this, diſcipline and good education are ſo neceſſarie, that without theſe it is impoſsible, or at leaſt verie hard, that a man ſhould become vertuous: For in Children and boyes, the right vſe of reaſon wanting, (being the Chariot of vertues) and they euer being by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed, it is requiſite, that the right reaſon of fathers and mothers, ſhould be that which ſhould ſupply their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and by little and little inure them vnto vertue. The Philoſopher vnderſtanding well of how ſpeciall importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it was to a wel inſtituted commonwealth, liberally to beget
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16643:51"/>and bring vp children well, hee concludeth the Treatiſe of his Politiks in procreation, and good education of children, teaching all thoſe meanes and rules, which are neceſſary, for to diſpoſe and aſſweat them vnto vertue: And <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Spartane, amongſt other his laws, made this one moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and good, that to all actions of boyes, their Maiſters ſhould be aſsiſtant, who had an eye, that euen in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes children ſhould not commit any vniuſt acte; holding this for a firme concluſion, that of wicked children ſprung vitious young men; and of youth vitious, men impious, as alſo of flagitious men, olde ribawdes: and to this concluſion conſenteth the diuine philoſopher, in the ſixt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the firſt of his Politickes, and ſixt of his Moralles, they affirming that a man euill brought vp, prooueth worſe than any wilde beaſt. Riches alſo is of great moment, to the acquiring and practiſing of vertue, for as it is harde without wealth to apply our ſelues to liberall Artes, ſo is it likewiſe difficult where pouertie is, that there ſhould be good education, and conſequently, vertus. For worldly want, is the mother of Arts moechanicall, &amp; wealth of Artes liberall, and of noble and vertuous actions. It being therefore neceſſary, that theſe three things ſhould concurre together, to the attaining of vertue, that is, temperature, good education, and riches, it being difficult in one man, to find theſe three vnited, of neceſsitie (moſt famous Lorde) the vertuous muſt be few, &amp; vitious many in number. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then, replied <hi>Don Caeſar,</hi> may we not ſuppoſe, that man is rather in the number of many wicked, than of a few good, eſpecially beeing ſo hard and difficult to prooue good and vertuous.</p>
            <p>Becauſe euery thing, if it be not hindered, continually worketh, rather according to the inclination of his ſpeciall forme, than generall, anſwered <hi>Gualenguo,</hi> and reaſonable nature, beeing the ſpeciall forme of man, by which from other creatures hee is different, and irrationall condition, his forme generall, wee muſt ſuppoſe, not knowing to the

               </gap>e, for notwithſtanding the contrarie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times happeneth, this is not by the proper nature of man, but becauſe matter and ſence make reſiſtance. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of beeing more men vitious then vertuous, the ſame reaſon may bee aſſsigned, which Signior <hi>Patritio</hi> the other day alleadged, from the greater number of deformed, then beautifull: For as in forming corporall beautie, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſiſting Ideall reaſon, procureth, that Nature, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, againſt her intention, giueth deformitie, ſo in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vertue which is the proper beautie of the minde, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter making reſiſtance to Ideal humane reaſon, is a cauſe, that ſhee againſt her intention many times, runneth into vice, being the true deformitie of the minde.</p>
            <p>The moſt noble Lord <hi>Don Caeſar,</hi> without any further motion, ſhewed himſelfe herewith to bee ſatisfied. And Signior <hi>Caualier Bernieri</hi> who ſate hard by him, doubted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: If the priuate ſuppoſition of another mans valor and bountie, were true, this inconuenience would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, that an inſolent fellow, whoſe flagitions were concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, might bee an honourable man, and yet (if the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher in his Ethickes, be worthie of credit) honor agreeth not but with an honeſt man. When ſoeuer a man (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) committeth a malificence, ſuddenly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he falleth into the penaltie of infamie. Yet doth he delaie his puniſhment, ſo much the longer, by how much the ſlower he is in reuealing his offence. A wicked man therefore, though of himſelfe he bee vnworthy, may yet bee honourable, becauſe hee looſeth not that inward ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his being good, except hee make it euident and manifeſt, that he hath failed in Iuſtice, or valor: And this is no greater inconuenience, then is that, when a theefe by the law is not puniſhed, his offence beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</p>
            <p>Touching the authority of the Philoſopher, it is true that the honeſt man is only worthy of honor, yet this is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16643:52"/>but that one flagitious may be therof na vnworthy poſſeſſor. Put the caſe, replied the Knight, that one had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a flagition, or performed ſome villanie, of which, only one or twoo had notice; ſhall this man therefore bee infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous? Cleauing to our foundations layde, ſayde <hi>Gualenguo</hi> this man ſhal be diſhonorable, and infamous, mary not with all men, but onelie with thoſe, who ſhall be acquainted with this malefact. This woulde bee a maruellous inconuenience, obiected <hi>Bernieri,</hi> becauſe it woulde followe, that in one inſtant time, the ſame man ſhoulde bee honourable, and infamous. It woulde bee inconuenient, anſwered <hi>Cua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenguo,</hi> whenas at the ſelfe-ſame time, and for the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he were honourable and infamous, but being in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners conſiderations, it is not onely, no inconuenience, but moreouer neceſſary, becauſe they to whome the offence is knowne, looſe the good opinion they had of him; and they thereof ignorant, reſerue it muiolate, while hee maketh manifeſtation thereof. And this is one of the principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt imperfections, that this our houour hath annexed vnto it, in that an vnworthie man may eaſily bee partaker of it, which to perfect honour is not incident. <hi>Bernieri</hi> replied no further, and the noble Signior <hi>Aldarano</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Carara,</hi> a Lord adorned with moſt noble cuſtomes, and of good Letters, very ſtudious, propounded his doubt, the which was, Whether that an honeſt man might bee infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Gualenguo:</hi> There is no doubt (noble Lorde) but an honeſt man, eyther through falſe calumniation, or vppon preſumption of maleficence, may looſe the good opinion, the worlde hadde of him; which hauing loſt, he falleth into infamy. But this is a great inconuenience, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marqueſſe, that he who neuer failed in iuſtice, nor valor, may be infamous.</p>
            <p>The nature of this honor, is ſubiect to theſe &amp; ſuch like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, anſwered <hi>Gualenguo,</hi> yet is it a thing very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, that an honeſt man ſhuld loſe his honor, as alſo it is not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16643:53"/>a thing ſo eaſie, that a man wicked ſhould auoyd infamie, for time in the end diſcouereth truth. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſomtimes it may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that an honeſt man, may enter into a bad fame, yet muſt he endeuor in all his actions, not only to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but alſo free from all ſuſpition of offence, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes his eyes open, that hee giue no occaſion of ſcandale, or preſumption to the worlde to iudge euil; for the enuious and malignant take occaſion of euery probabilitie, to ſtaine the honor of an honeſt man.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe was ſatisfied with this anſwere, and the Count of <hi>Scandiano,</hi> a moſt valorous Knight: Mee thinkes ſayd he, that you, ſir Knight, haue very vniuſtly placed the adulterer in the number of men diſhonored, bicauſe cuſtome is contrary; ſeeing that men, are not onely, not aſhamed to commit adultery, but as of an enterpriſe honourable, they haue no ſooner performed it, as that therof they vawnt, and make great boaſt: ney ther is it intended, that any one ſhould euer be refuſed, in compariſon of honour; for being an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, notwithſtanding that of theſe, the number be infinite. I am deſirous therefore, that you would giue me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how it may be, that an adulterer ſhould be infamous. A man, anſwered the Knight, committeth adultery in two ſortes, in one, when he being bound, falſifieth the oth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, frequenting with a looſe woman. And in this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be worthy of ſome blame, yet looſeth he not his honour, becauſe he iniurieth none but his owne wife: in the other, when married or vnbound, he vſeth the company of a woman married. And this man remaineth diſhonoured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he finneth extreamely againſt the vertue of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and faileth in iuſtice, hee beeing a greeuous iniurier or deſtroyer of an other mans honour; the which (as I haue ſaide) of all other goods externall, is the moſt pretious: and therfore deſeruedly by the lawes, is there impoſed on adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery a greater penalty, than on theft, becauſe the adulterer endamnifieth in honor, and theft but in goodes. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though men, through euill cuſtome, are not aſhamed to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16643:53"/>for adulterers, yet is this no obſtacle, but that they are worthy of infamy: or that in combate they may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, when by men honeſt, it ſhal be obiected vnto them, as well as theeues. Seeing a man, replied the Count, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not his honour, but when hee conuerſeth with a married woman, I would willingly vnderſtand, if the like happeneth to a woman, which is, that ſhe ſhall not forgo her honor, but when ſhe ioyneth with one married: for in my iudgement, a womans condition, in this ſhould not be worſe than a mans. A woman, ſayde <hi>Gualenguo,</hi> as in many other things, ſo in this, is of harder condition than a man: firſt, in that if ſhe be maried, with her owne, ſhee alſo ſtaineth the honour of her husband: ſecondarily, for that ſhe being (as the Philoſopher affirmeth) by reaſon ſubiect to man, committeth the greater iniury; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the iniurie is greater, of an inferiour towardes his ſuperior, than of a ſuperior towardes an inferior: thirdly, becauſe ſhee may bring into her houſe other mens children, diſpoſſeſsing the proper childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her husband, of his goods: fourthly, for that a woman, offendeth extreamely againſt her owne proper and principall vertue, which is honeſtie. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man therfore cannot after this maner, accompany with others than her husband, reſeruing ſtill her honour, but thus dooing, ſhee incurreth infamie. <hi>Scandiano</hi> ſeemed to bee well reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>When Counte <hi>Guido Calcagnino,</hi> moued this queſtion. You ſaide, that he, who flying, abandoneth his colors, forgoeth his honor: I further deſire to know, Whether a valiant ſouldier, ſeeing all others forſake the colors, may with honor flie, and remoue himſelfe from daunger: or ought, for maintenance of his honour, to remaine dead by his auntient or colours. And <hi>Gualenguo:</hi> according to the lawe of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Spartanes, the ſouldier ſhould bee bound rather to die than abandon his enſigne for any accident whatſoeuer; and therefore the ſeuere and rigorous mother was wont to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto her ſonne, that went to battell, his ſhield with theſe words, <hi>Eyther with this, or in this:</hi> giuing him to vnderſtand
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16643:54"/>thereby, that either he ſhuld returne victorious, or remaine dead: I am notwithſtanding of opinion, that when an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man hath performed his duty in fighting, and yet for all this, ſeeth all the other ſouldiours betake themſelues to flight, and knoweth himſelfe not able to reſiſt the force of the enemies; ſuch an one retiring himſelfe into ſafety, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not his honor, but rather, they that firſt fled remaine diſhonored. If one, replied <hi>Calcagnino,</hi> ſhould abandon his friend or companion, in danger, eſteeming himſelfe not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to defend him, by reaſon of inequalitie in number, ſhould he in this caſe looſe his honor? If his friend, anſwered <hi>Gualenguo,</hi> with armes in hand turned himſelfe to defence, and he on the contrary made away, there is no queſtion but he ſhould looſe his honour, neyther would the excuſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie help him a whit, for the valiant man is not daunted in ſodaine daunger, but the ſlaue and villaine. I would not haue thought, added the Count, that a man had beene tyed to do more than hee can, but that rather, he had bin raſh and heady, which eſteemeth too much of his owne force, as one ſhould be, who to ſaue his friend, did fight againſt ten men ſeueral. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> he that without any other neceſsitie ſhould make choiſe to fight at one inſtant againſt ten, ſhuld certainly be rather preſumptuous than valiant; but an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man beeing in company with his friend, ought not to forſake him, though he ſawe himſelfe incountred by ten ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral ſwords, but muſt rather feare the loſſe of honor, than of his life. By the ſelfeſame reaſon, replied <hi>Calcagnino,</hi> whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were in battel, he ought to ſtand, though all the reſtſled.</p>
            <p>The caſe is much different, ſayd <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> becauſe he in the field withdrawing himſelfe from danger, and other men flying, doth not abandon, but is abandoned; whereas contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, one that leaueth his friend in daunger, is he that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh, and is not left, or abandoned: wherefore he commeth to faile in valour, and manifeſting, that hee eſteemeth more his life, than his honor, hee remaineth infamous. <hi>Calcagnino</hi> held his peace, and Counnt <hi>Palla Strozza</hi> a moſt valiant ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16643:54"/>doubted after this maner: You haue placed him amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt men diſhonourable, who with his proper valour, makes no ſhew of being touched with an iniurie: Put the caſe one were iuſtly iniuried, ſhould he, to auoyde the loſſe of honor, manifeſt himſelfe therewith prouoked? Out of doubt hee ought, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> and if he knowing himſelfe to be in the wrong, replied <hi>Strozza,</hi> ſhould offend him iniurying, failed he not in iuſtice, and ſo conſequently, ſhould hee not looſe his honor, this honour being principally grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opinion of the world? <hi>Gualenguo</hi> returned: A man, how good or wicked ſoeuer hee bee, muſt reſpect none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but to preſerue this opinion, if hee deſire to be an honorable man: For honour periſheth not before this opinion be loſt; and opinion cannot be loſt before ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be manifeſtand made knowne: the iniuried therefore, notwithſtanding he knoweth himſelf to be iuſtly offended, muſt labour that the worlde haue no notice of it; and this hee ſhall do, by reuenging the iniurie in proper valor: for by not failing in volour, his defect in iuſtice ſhalbe concealed: but on the contrary, if he ſhal beare the iniury, not to commit an vniuſt fact, the world wil iudge, that hauing wanted valour, he alſo failed in iuſtice: and that therefore he is woorthy of iniurie and contempt.</p>
            <p>By this your concluſion, added <hi>Strozzi,</hi> a great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience would follow: that one to auoide the loſſe of honor, ought to maintaine an vniuſt quarrell, a thing not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by any of theſe, who haue intreated of honor and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; they holding it for ſure, that to fight hauing the wrong on our ſide, is no other but to prouoke the iuſt iudgement God, in that by many experiences it is wel known, that they who haue maintained the wrong, haue either beene ſlaine, or vanquiſhed by their enemie, although he in force were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior vnto them: where vpon they affirme, that he which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth his offence &amp; requireth pardon, is leſſe diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable then he, that moued by a diabolical ſpirit, obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeketh to couer it within the liſtes. All they anſwered
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16643:55"/>
               <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> which hetherto haue written of honor and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, are fallen into manifeſt errours, by not hauing entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowen, the nature of this honour: for maintenance whereof, there is euery day braules, and wherevppon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is grounded: for then amongſt other things, they would not haue ſaide, that an honorable man ought not to maintaine an vniuſt quarell, for preſeruation of his honor: and notwithſtanding what they ſaid, is conformable to a Chriſtian, who neuer ought to enter into an action, which offendeth God: yet for al this, it is not conuenient for them, who value the honor of the worlde: for ſuch like men deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be honored, muſt indeuour by right and wrong, not to loſe that opinion, and ſuppoſition wherewith they are borne, but queſtionleſſe this is as oftentimes loſt, as a man manifeſteth to the world, that he hath failed in iuſtice or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor. And how can it be, further vrged <hi>Strozza,</hi> that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man going againſt his own conſcience, ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an vniuſt quarell? An honeſt man, ſaide <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> can neuer maintaine an vniuſt quarell, for reaſon will euer with him be at hand, but an honorable man may well fight being in wrong, to auoide the loſſe of honor. Then an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, &amp; an honorable man, be not all one, added <hi>Stroz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi:</hi> and <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> By the foundations I laide, it may bee cleare vnto you, that an honeſt man, and an honorable, bee not the ſelfe ſame things: and in this they haue beene decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that write in the argument of honor and combate: for it may bee, that an honorable man, ſhall not likewiſe be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; as alſo that one may be a man honeſt, and not honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as wee haue ſufficiently declared. What intend you by a man honorable? ſaide <hi>Strozzi:</hi> By a man of honor, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> I meane all thoſe whatſoeuer they bee, good or wicked, who haue not loſt the good opinion that the worlde conceiued of them.</p>
            <p>Therefore I conclude, that an honorable man, is tyed in right or wrong by his own proper valor, to repell an iniury, and alſo to maintaine an vniuſt quarell, leſt he remaine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16643:55"/>
               <hi>Strozzi</hi> ſaide no more. And although this poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the firſt appearance, ſeemed to all the ſtanders by, a paradox, yet was it by the greater part of the Gentlemen approoued for moſt true. When Count <hi>Hercules Beuelac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua,</hi> vnto whom by order it belonged to propound; ſeeing honor, ſaide he, is both in right and wrong to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I would willingly vnderſtand, if an honorable man, after he hath valiantly fought within the liſtes, and brought to that point, as he cannot longer defend himſelfe, ought rather to yeeld, then permit, that his enimie kill him. This, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> is not a doubt of ſmall importance: and the opinions of famous and learned men be in this point di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: the greater part affirming, that the combatant ought rather to die, then yeeld: for in any caſe, a man of honor ſhuld alwaies preferre death, before infamous ſafetie. And this the Philoſopher teſtifieth in the 3 of his morals ſaying, A valiant man ought much more to feare infamy then death: and alſo in another place of his Morals. that an honourable man, ſhould rather chooſe a ſhort life honourable, then a life long, but contumelious. And vpon this foundation, the Stoikes in ſome caſes, permitted the violent killing of ones ſelfe, to auoyde a diſhonorable life. As alſo the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who in fortitude and warlike valor, excelled alother Grecians, commaunded their ſouldiers that they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yeeld, they holding it for certaine, that they which died with weapon in hand, might rather be eſteemed ſlaine, then ſubdued: &amp; therefore their great captain <hi>Leonidas,</hi> who with three hundred ſouldiers, defended <hi>Thermopolis</hi> againſt the innumerable armie of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> was not ouercome, but killed, neither were the three hundred Fabians vanquiſhed, but ſlaine. Diuine <hi>Plato</hi> eſteemed it ſo contamelious a thing, to yeeld, as that in his commonwealth he ordained, that there ſhould be no redemption for him that yeelded, but that hee might bee ſet as a prey to the enemy: and in the twelfe of his lawes, he made one moſt ſeuere, againſt thoſe, who in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile ſurrendred themſelues, as varquiſhed, affirming, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16643:56"/>free men ſhould more feare to bee made ſlaues, then haue any dreade of death it ſelfe. He therefore that yeeldeth within the liſts to his enemie, remaining his ſlaue, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of honour, whereas being killed, he may rather be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſlaine, then ſubdued: it ſeemeth, that brought to that neceſsity, he ought rather to endure death, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer to yeeld himſelf, yet for al this, I hold the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie opinion to be true, &amp; I am moued by this firme foundation: For in Combat, the cauſe is no leſſe loſt by death, then by ſubmiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but betwixt ſubmiſsion and death there is this difference: that he who yeeldeth, looſeth onely his honour, but the other remaining dead, looſeth both honour, life, and that is worſe, his owne ſoule: neither will any denie me, but that hee had rather chooſe one alone, then all theſe three euilles togither, and no man is bound to do more then his force wil extendvnto. Whereas it is a raſh part, and altogither aduerſe to nature and humane conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for no benefit to ſuffer death, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by the ſame any thing honeſt: I will further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that hee which in the Liſts hath not failed in valour, although vrged by neceſsitie hee yeeldeth himſelfe, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not wholly diſhonoured: nay and ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that the vanquiſhed, with men of vnderſtanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a better opinion then the victor, in that the vertue of the mind, is knowne rather in aduerſe then proſperous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and a man giueth teſtimony of himſelfe, and his valor in blood, wounds, and eminent danger of death. Finally, I will further alleadge, that a man not beeing borne ſo much for himſelfe, as for his Country, ought not without vrgent neceſsity, to depriue his country of a valiant champion. The reaſons alleadged to the contrary are true. Suppoſing with the Philoſopher, (which is falſe) that chiefe good cannot be without worldly honor; but becauſe they are grounded on a ſuppoſition diuers from ours, they no waie preiudice our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: For they ſuppoſe, that with an honorable death, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhunneth infamy, &amp; that his former life remaineth vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but if I imagin the ruth, his whol life paſt remaineth no leſſe infamous by death, then by yeelding himſelfe, becauſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16643:56"/>he which dieth, be he defenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or aſſailant, reſteth in opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue failed, either in iuſtice or valor, &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored. This opinion of <hi>Gualinguos,</hi> was confirmed by the greater part of the gentlme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; thoſe in points of honor moſt iudiciall: when the illuſtrous Signior <hi>Hippolito Bentiuogli:</hi> if I carry well in minde, the Philoſopher affirmeth in his Rethoricke, that nor only hee which offendeth our ſelues, offereth vs iniurie, but alſo he who wrongeth thoſe thinges belonging to vs: as our father, ſon, brother, frend, or ſuch like, I would know, if in point of honor we are bound to reuenge ſuch an iniurie. When <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> that ſuch an iniurie ſhould tie vs to reuenge, it is requiſite there depend vppon it theſe conditions; firſt, that it be performed in contempt of vs, &amp; through no manifeſt fault of him offended; further, that he iniuried, be impotent, for if he were ſufficient to reuenge of himſelfe, by taking vpon him the burden of his honor, hee ſhould come to diſhonour himſelfe; therefore the Father is not tied to reuenge the iniury of his ſtrong &amp; able childe, as neither the Sonne his Fathers wrong, when of himſelfe he is ſufficient to anſwer the offender: and to conclude, the ſtrong &amp; mightie, ſtandeth bound to anſwer for the weake, and impotent, conſidering the iniurie is done in deſpight of him, that can reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge himſelf, when it is not offred throgh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manifeſt fault of him offended: for otherwiſe to reuenge his cauſe who is iuſtly offended, were no other, but to faile in iuſtice, &amp; therfore I ſay by manifeſt fault, becauſe if it were ſecret, he is by al means to endeuor to keep it cloſe, that hee offended reſt not infamous. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that we are, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to protect our ſelues, but alſo the honor of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that belong to vs. <hi>Bentiuoglie</hi> was ſatisfied, &amp; count <hi>Alfonſo Turchie</hi> You, if I vnderſtood well, ſaid he, haue recounted hereſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe defects that depriue of honor, and this, in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, hath in it ſome difficulty, ſeeing honor &amp; diſhonor agree with action, &amp; not with opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſin or maleficence, as the Philoſopher affirmeth, in the ſixt of his Ethikes, is not properly of knowledge, nor of opinion, and it is cleare, that hereſy is no other but an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which thogh it be falſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16643:57"/>yet ſhall not hee herewith poſſeſſed, reſt infamous, and the reaſon is readie, made by the ſame Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in the third of his Ethikes: for honour, diſhonor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and puniſhment, follow thoſe actions that depend on free will, and are in our power, but the ſin of hereſie is not in our power, ſeeing we cannot enter into what opinion wee would, but are inforced to beleeue what the minde iudgeth to be true, or like to truth.</p>
            <p>Although hereſie (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) as it it is an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can neither giue nor take away honor: notwithſtanding in as much as it is a beginning to work againſt holy laws, &amp; Catholike decrees, it maketh a man more then all other ſinnes, infamous, when either by tongue, or exterior actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhe commeth to manifeſt her ſelfe. Diſtinguiſhing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I affirme that heretikes are of two ſorts: the one ſecret, who neither with words nor deeds, diſcouer their Hereſie: and theſe, though they looſe the fauour of God, yet do they not forgoe their honour, for the reaſons aboue cited: The other kind be manifeſt, which impudently ſtriue againſt the lawes and inſtitutions of holy Chriſtian Church: &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeke to drawe this and that man into their peruerſe opinion, by ſcandalizing the world, and therefore looſe their honour, they being held in the opinion of the world, to haue failed in iuſtice, and to be moſt notable deſtroyers of ſoules health, the which of honeſt men ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all other goods. Vndoubtedly ſayd Count <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> theſe ſorts of men, are not onely worthie of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall infamie, and in compariſon of honour to bee excepted againſt, but for chaſticement, are right woorthie of the fire. I am alſo in doubt, ſaide <hi>Scipion Sacrati,</hi> neither can I ſee, how it may be, that an vſurer ſhould looſe his honour; as alſo I cannot perceiue, in what reſpect hee faileth in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or valour: but I call to minde a Dialogue of a great learned man, wherein he prooueth, that vſurie is neceſſarie to liue well and happily. It is neceſſarie, anſwered <hi>Gualin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guo,</hi> that husbandmen ſhould be great vſurers, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgill</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16643:57"/>and that they ſhould labour, that the earth may render an hundred for one, and after this manner doth lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Spocone</hi> entend it in his dialogue: but the vſurer whom I place among men diſhonored, is not ſuch a one: but rather one that is vniuſt, and who practiſeth againſt good lawes, ſeeking vnlawfull gaine, and vſing monye contrarie to his proper nature. And wherefore againſt his proper nature, replied <hi>Sacrati?</hi> Becauſe, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> mony by the law, was to no other ende found out, but to make contracts equall, in the exchange of things, wherevpon he that vſeth it without any change, imploieth it contrarie to his nature, and againſt the ordinance of the law: But ſuch a one is the vſurer, becauſe he changeth not his mony for commoditie, but mony immediatly for mony, and therefore vſurie by the Grecians was tearmed <hi>Focos,</hi> which ſignifieth one begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for as the childe is like him that begot him, ſo mony imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the vſurer, is like the mony, which without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only with the benefit of time, it bringeth forth. The vſurer deſeruedly therefore is put in the number of thoſe infamous, becauſe by an euill meane, he waſteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods. <hi>Sacrati</hi> ſaid no more: When Count <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eule Taſſone:</hi> ſeeing honor is loſt by failing in iuſtice, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, I would furder vnderſtand, whether of theſe two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects deeplyer wound honor. Queſtionleſſe honour cannot be loſt but in defect of Iuſtice, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> neither doth want of valor, touch honor in any other reſpect, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with ſuch a defect, there is annexed iniuſtice, or the caracter thereof. I vnderſtand you not after my minde, ſaide <hi>Taſſone:</hi> and <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> He which through vilitie hazardeth not his life, for Religion, his Countrie, Prince, and Friends, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth an vniuſt fact: for a man not being borne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but for all theſe, defraudeth his Countrie, Prince, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Friends, of that which is their proper good: and therefore as vniuſt hee is worthy of infamie: hee likewiſe, that is not moued with an iniurie, beſides that he infringeth the lawe of Nature, which permitteth euery one to repell
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16643:58"/>force with force, he carrieth alſo with him the caracter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice. And how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this be, replied <hi>Taſſone,</hi> if to ſuffer iniury as the Philoſopher affirmeth, is free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vice, &amp; to offer it, is vitious &amp; vniuſt. The Philoſopher ſaith wel, anſwered <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linguo,</hi> but yet this taketh not away my poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for thogh the ſuffring of iniurie be without vice, yet giueth it ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of vice in the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for that by this act of ſupporting iniury, he ſheweth himſelf worthie of contempt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, vniuſt, and wicked; for only the wicked man is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ignominious. Seeing honor is not loſt, added <hi>Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone,</hi> but through want of iuſtice, and defect of valor is a kind of iniuſtice, this word Valor, in the definition of honor, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be ſuperfluous. The common ſort, ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> not knowing, that iuſtice comprehendeth al vertues, &amp; iniuſtice al vices, and ordinarily diſtinguiſhing between baſe actions, and thoſe of iniuſtice, to make men learned, as alſo vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, conceiue the nature of this our honor: the word valor is not only not ſuperfluous, but neceſſary, and ſo much the more, by reaſon common opinion holdeth baſe &amp; coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, more infamous then thoſe vniuſt: and in euery one, want of valor is more obſerued, then that of iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſaid Count <hi>Hercules,</hi> the abuſe is growne ſo far, as all men valiant of perſon are eſteemed honeſt men, although in the reſt they be moſt diſſolute. This hapneth anſwered <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linguo,</hi> becauſe the common ſort, which know not the inward vertues of the mind, meaſureth the goodnes and valor of a man, from the force of his body, &amp; not from the power of his mind, little obſeruing, that as man by the vertue of the mind, exceedeth the creatures, ſo in ſtrength of body, by many beaſts he is excelled. <hi>Taſſone</hi> ſaid nothing elſe, but count <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Moſti</hi> obiected: tel me ſir knight, if this our honor once loſt, may be recouered again. Let euerie one take heed, ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> of looſing his honor, for being once iuſtly loſt, it can neuer be recouered: and I ſaid iuſtly, becauſe loſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it may rather be termed honour ſuſpended then loſt, as it happeneth to thoſe honeſt men, who by falſe ſuggeſtions
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16643:58"/>enter into the euill opinion of the world, ſeeing it may come to paſſe, that time in the ende diſcouering the trueth, they may recouer their good name. You impoſe too ſeuere a law vpon honor. Signior <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> replied Count <hi>Hercules,</hi> in that it onely being once loſt, you giue out, it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: for my part, I iudge it ſcarce reaſonable, that one bad action cannot by many other good be recompenſed, for this is no other, but to bring an offender into extreame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation: by which meane honour, that in a man ought to be the principall cauſe of doing well, would be an occaſion for him to multiplie his flagitions, without euer reforming them. By my definition of honour deliuered, you ſhould bee out of doubt (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) that honour iuſtly loſt, cannot be recouered. For if it be true that honour is a firme opinion in him that honoureth, that he honoured hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> led in iuſtice nor valor: one that hath only failed once, &amp; is known for the man, cannot come within the compaſſe of this definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe then it ſhould not be conuertible with the defirite, and would be no other, but as if we ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe a reaſonable ſoule to an aſſe. But if men, added <hi>Moſti,</hi> ſhould turne to haue as good an opinion of ſuch an one, as at the firſt, might he not, recouering the priuiledge of honour, come within this definition? If we ſhould grant, ſaid <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linguo,</hi> that an aſſe had winges, we might conclude, that hee were a birde and fowle, therfore I ſay vnto you, that this caſe in him can hardly be admitted, who hath iuſtly loſt his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, becauſe they who haue notice of his defect, althogh they would, yet could they not of ſuch an one retaine ſo good an opinion, as at the firſt, if they loſt not alſo theyr owne memories, the which is hard, or at leaſt verie difficult. For men for the moſt parte, being enuious and maleuolent, they are vnmindfull of vertuous actions, keeping them cloſe, but they reſerue freſh in memorie another mans miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes, and continually with their tongues blaze it abroad: and touching this ſeuere and ſtrict law of honor, I ſay it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, but yet iuſt, and likewiſe thoſe lawes be iuſt, though
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16643:59"/>auſtere, that cut off the liues of malefactors, or their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, the which things, though they be irrecouerable, yet cannot theſe chaſticements hold malefactors in: but if the feare of loſſe were recompenced with the hope of recouerie, who ſeeth not how great the number of wicked men would bee, and of thoſe ready to worke miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>The law of honor then, is the cauſe of wel doing, &amp; not of multiplying flagition, becauſe the greater ſort of men hold their honor ſo deare, as that they dare not do euill, for feare of the loſſe therof, knowing that it once only being loſt, can neuer be recouered. But for al this, I do not affirme, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who hath ceaſed the honor of the world, ſhould vppon this multiply in flagitions, without euer reforming himſelfe, but rather the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the recouery of the former good opinion, cannot do better, then manifeſt to the world in all his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s enſuing, that he is penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; turned to a better life: for though it may wel be, that he ſhall hardly be able to returne to his firſt degree of honor, yet he may become a good man, &amp; ſhun continuall reproach. And how ſhould it come to paſſe, replied <hi>Mosti,</hi> that proouing a good man, he ſhould not likewiſe become honourable: I pray you tell me, is not an honeſt man worthy of honor? If you deny this, you frame a paradox againſt the Philoſopher, who affirme, that onely the honeſt man is woorthy of honour. An honeſt man, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> is two maner of wayes vnderſtood: One is, he that neuer crackt his credit, but is wel knowne for ſuch an one, and this man is truely worthy of honor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly honored: The other is he, who hauing once or twice failed, and knowne for ſuch an one, in the end amendeth, and becommeth good; this man is not abſolutely woorthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, neither can he be counted honorable, but only in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of a man impious. Count <hi>Hercules</hi> was content with this laſt diſtinction: when Count <hi>Gherardo Beuelacqui,</hi> I ſaw ſaide he, in the booke of <hi>Poſſeuiuo,</hi> intituled, of Honour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other, this one notable diſputation, whether honor conſiſteth in the honorer, or him honoured, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16643:59"/>he greatly laboreth to reſſolue this difficultie, yet my conceit was not therewith ſatisfied; for by one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſeemes to haue reſidence in the honorer, ſeeing in him is placed that opinion, which you auerre to be honor. On the other ſide, it appeareth rather to be in him honored, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he giueth denomination to the ſubiect, and that as milke for the whiteneſſe is in it, commeth to be tearmed white, ſo the honored is ſo called, for the honor in himſelfe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode: I deſire therefore to heare you vpon this poynt.</p>
            <p>This doubt, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> hath giuen diuers occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſcuſsion, and eſpecially <hi>Poſſeuiuo,</hi> but becauſe what he ſaith, nothing toucheth this honor whereof we intreat, but rather that which is acquired by beneficence, we wil leaue it apart: therefore ſtanding on the foundation of our naturall honor, we muſt obſerue, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuppoſed good, if nothing appeere to the contrary, honor proceedeth from the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant image of the vertue of the honoured, imprinted in the fantaſie of the honorer: and becauſe good opinion is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eſſence of honor, we will ſay, that honor eſſentially is in the honorer, &amp; in the honored vertually (to vſe theſe terms) eſſentially in the honorer, bicauſe in him remaineth the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; vertually in the honored, for that in him is the hidden vertue, which of it ſelfe cauſeth imagination in the fantaſie of the honorer, procuring opinion. This anſwer well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Count <hi>Gherardo,</hi> and replying no further, Signior <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole Gilioli:</hi> There riſeth in my mind a doubt, ſayd he, which ſpringeth from that before you affirmed, man to bring with him this honor, from his mothers wombe: If this be true, I cannot ſee how honor ſhould eſſentially be in the honored, ſeeing hee enioyeth it not from his birth, and if in him it bee eſſentially, how can it be recounted amongſt goodes exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall? Man, as I haue ſaide, anſwered <hi>Gua.</hi> bringeth with him honor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mothers womb, becauſe he is borne with that inward ſuppoſition, that he is good, neither is it requiſit, that to preſerue this ſuppoſition, he labour greatly, in that it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth only, he neuer extremely offend againſt any principal
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16643:60"/>vertue. And for that of this ſuppoſition, in the end groweth opinion, in him honouring, which is honor, therefore it is ſaide to be eſſentially in the honourer. Yet is not to him as his owne, but as a thing appropriate to the honored. I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme therefore, that notwithſtanding the honored is borne with poſſeſsion of honor, yet makes not this, that in him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſhould eſſentially be: for if that were true, we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that riches likewiſe were eſſentially in the wealthy man, ſeeing he is borne to poſſeſsion of them, and that they were not to bee placed amongſt goodes externall. Signior <hi>Hercules</hi> held his peace, and the Lord <hi>Caeſar Brancaccio</hi> whom now it concerned to propound, muſing alitle with himſelfe: Me thinkes, ſaide he, that this our honor, (and ours I call it, ſeeing Nature and Fortune offereth vnto vs, without our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie) giueth occaſion of doubt in this, I not hauing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto heard any one queſtion propounded, pertaining to that true honor, which by vertue and valour is obtained, as though the Knight had ſo amply entreated, as that nothing remayned whereof you might doubt; I notwithſtanding am not altogether ſatisfied: for if it be true, that this honor is a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward that ſheweth and exalteth the woorke of beneficence, and that not onely thoſe are honored, who haue perſormed benefites, but he alſo is eſteemed, that is likely to be benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, this inconuenience inſueth, that a wicked fellow, who ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, or is likely to benefit, may be worthy of honor, as on the contrary, an honeſt man vnworthy, bicauſe he neither hath, and is altogether vnable to performe any benefit. The man wicked, ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> can in no ſort be woorthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, although he either hath, or may performe a benefite, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prouided, that he be knowne for flagitious: firſt, in that he depriued of naturall honor, is incapable of any other: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the woorke of beneficence ſimply ſufficeth not, to make one worthy of honor, being requiſite, that ſuch an action ſhould be perfourmed by an honeſt man, and to no other end: for he that ſhould place a benefit to thend to reap therof gaine or delight, ſuch an one ſhould not be worthy of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16643:60"/>honor, neither could he be thought ingrate, that were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of ſuch a benefit, or ſhould not therof make any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; but an honeſt man &amp; ſo knowne, doing benefit, is worthy of honor, becauſe he is beneficiall to no other but an honeſt end: neither can any be vertuous or good, which is not apt to performe benefites. If a vertuous man, replied <hi>Brancaccio</hi> were in calamitie or pouerty, how could he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall? And <hi>Gual:</hi> The means of benefiting be diners: for we may do good to the body, to the ſoule, by good examples ſetting forth morall vertues and knowledge, or with phiſick procuring health to the body: Finally, as it cannot chuſe, but the Sun muſt needes heate and illuminate, ſo is it impoſsible, that a vertuous and good man ſhould not be beneficiall, and conſequently, vnworthy of honor.</p>
            <p>If they, added <hi>Brancaccio,</hi> that for profit, benefite, and not for honeſtie were not worthy of honour, the Doctours that reade publikly, the Phyſitions that adminiſter health to the body, aduocates that defend goods and titles, and other like vertuous men, who notwithſtanding do great good, ſhould be vnworthily honored: ſeeing all theſe practiſe their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for profite. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> If theſe were principally moued by profit, aod not honeſty, out of all doubt they could not be worthy of honor, but if practiſing for honeſtie, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they attaine profite, they ſhal not for this be vnworthy: and eſpecially the Doctours, who reade publikely, for they are publikely payd, and publike ſtipends, are in the number of poynts honorable. By good reaſon alſo Phyſitions are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, becauſe in them there is vertue, and their end is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed honeſt, in that they ſet not their labor at ſale: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they extend foorth the hand, to receiue that which is giuen them, yet do they this, becauſe a gift is accoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted as a point honorable, and a reward of beneficent and wel dooing action: and therefore as the Philoſopher ſayeth, a gift is equallye deſired by the ambitious, as by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, of the ambitious for honour, of the couetous man for profite. At this laſt anſwer, the Ladies and Knights
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16643:61"/>ſmiled, and Signior <hi>Brancaccio</hi> replied no further. But Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Scipion Gilioli</hi> took occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the doubt propounded by Signior <hi>Guilio Caeſar:</hi> I would willingly know, ſayd he, ſeeing a wicked man by the worke of beneficence, cannot make himſelfe worchie of honour, whether he may honour ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no: by one reaſon it ſeemeth no, in that hee cannot giue what hee hath not: but the wicked man hath no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: on the other ſide, if a wicked man ſhall receiue ſome ſingular benefit, from one honeſt and good, hee may in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence erect vnto him a Satue, make Himnes in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, offer him preſents, and ſuch like honours. A bad fellow, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> can in this do no honour to an honeſt man, who is truely honoured, but rather by ſuch like oſtentations hee diſhonoureth him, eſpecially when the man depraued doth him this honour: for hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſome benefit, either in his body or goods: for an honeſt man cannot doo good to the body or goods of one wicked, without giuing ſcandale of himſelfe, ſeeing hee is woorthy of honour, that doth good for honeſties ſake, and to a party heneſt.</p>
            <p>You ſaid, replied Signior <hi>Scipione,</hi> that a man might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies be beneficiall, that is, to the body, goods, and ſoule: put we the caſe, that a good man, by doctrine, good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and admonitions, do cure vpon the ſicke ſoule of one wicked, reducing him to better life, and that hee for ſuch a benefit ſhuld erect vnto him a ſtatue, as they do who hauing eſcaped a ſhipwrack, erect altares and ſtatues, to God &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſhould not this be honour to a vertuous man? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it ſhuld, &amp; that moſt great, ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> in that of al benefits hee hath performed the greateſt, which is, the health of the ſoule. Then inferred <hi>Gilioli,</hi> a man wicked may performe a moſt ſpecial honor, &amp; yet not long ſince you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it. I ſaid, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> that a depraued man could not giue honour, but hee which hauing receiued the health of his ſoule, doth honour, honoureth not as hee was wicked, but as hee is a good man, and therefore the honour he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16643:61"/>is not to bee deſpiſed, for though it bee not honeſt, that a good man ſhould further the bodie or goods of one wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet is it moſt honeſt to procure vnto him the health of his ſoule: and whoſoeuer performeth ſuch a benefit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe worthie of honour; Signior <hi>Scipione</hi> vſed no further ſpeech. When Signior <hi>Aleſſandro Andriaſi:</hi> You ſir Knight, haue defined this honor whereof we intreate, to be the rewarde of beneficence, if this definition were true, it would follow, that the inferior could not honour the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, for as it is proper to the ſuperior, to giue, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue rewarde, ſo is it proper to the inferior, to receiue and not giue. And <hi>Gualenguo:</hi> rewarde may be conſidered, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two ſortes, which be, as it is profitable, or as it is honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: as profitable it concurreth not with the definition of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor, but as it is honorable it therein taketh place. In this ſort therefore conſidered, it may be thus giuen by the inferior, as vnto him alſo from the ſuperior: for the recogniſance of vertue, is common both to the one and other. Yet is there this difference, by reaſon that what by the greater is giuen to the inferior, beſids being a note and teſtimonie of vertue, it ſheweth alſo ſupereminencie in the ſuperior, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requireth thankefulnes and gratitude: but that from the inferior to the greater, containing dutie, is a ſigne of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and is called reuerence. This excellent deſtinction pleaſed all the ſtanders by, and <hi>Andriaſi</hi> replying no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Signior <hi>Galiazzo Fiaſchi:</hi> I remember ſaid he amongſt other matters I ſaw in the booke of <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that honor conſiſteth more in deſert, then poſſeſsion; where of I doubt: and vpon this expect your opinion. And <hi>Gualenguo: Poſſeuino,</hi> or the author of that booke, as many other thinges, ſo doth he maintaine this concluſion againſt <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> from whom he ſheweth himſelfe altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and ſeperate: for if it were true, that honor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, rather in deſeruing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſeſsing thereof, that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhuld be ſalfe, which the Philoſopher affirmeth in the firſt of his Ethickes. That honor is not our owne, but depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16643:62"/>more of the honorer then him honored: neither could honor be recounted, amongſt goods externall, or of fortune: for though it be in our power, to make our ſelues worthy of honor, yet is it not in our power to receiue or poſſeſle it: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the ingratitude or ignorance of them, in whoſe hands iuſt diſtributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lieth, we are oft times deceiued. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conformable to this, <hi>Cicero</hi> cited this notable ſentence:
<q>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue for guide, but Fortune for companion, I would haue.</q> Minding to infer, that if the vertuous man haue not Fortune for his companion, he cannot haue peſſeſsion of honor: and that vertue without fortune, is of it ſelfe vnto it inſufficient: the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Cicero</hi> was held for truth. When <hi>Caualier Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino:</hi> Seing you ſir Knight haue concluded with the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and <hi>Ciceros</hi> authoritie, that honor conſiſteth rather in poſſeſsion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſert, I deſire to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d further: whether a vertuous &amp; prudent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ought to ſeek &amp; demand that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, whereof he knoweth himſelfe meritorious, or holding his peace, to attend while fortune accompany his valor and defect, with honorable charge, leauing al other meanes: In that by one reaſon it ſeemeth he ſhould not: for in ſeeking after them, he incurreth ſuſpect of ambition, which ought to be abhorred of an honeſt man: on the other ſide by not labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſuing after it, hee is in danger to be thereof depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and conſequently, not to be known for vertuous: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that honor is the enſigne of vertue: as by effect wee ſee, that ſom are eſteemed of valor, by enioying magiſtracy, titles, and other ſuch like honors, notwithſtanding that in them ſelues, they haue not the leaſt ſhadow of vertue. Then <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> It is the propertie of a vertuous and wiſe man, not to ſhew himſelfe deſirous of honor, neither to ſeeke or craue it, but directing all his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to honeſtie, by this mean to make himſelfe worthie of honor; yet ought he not to liue ſo contemptibly, as after the manner of <hi>Diogeues</hi> Cinicke, to manifeſt, that he holdeth honor in ſcorne, but rather when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer occaſion preſenteth it ſelfe, he ought with modeſtie to accept of thoſe honors that befit him, that he incurre not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16643:62"/>the vice of puſillanimitie. If it be true, replied <hi>Guirini,</hi> that honor is deſerued by vertue, and by fortune acquired: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, why a vertuous man may not ſeek at the hands of for tune, the honor he deſerueth, conſidering that fortune is not moued except ſhe be ſought vnto &amp; vrged: we being wont for this cauſe to ſay, that ſhe is not fauorable, to the timerous and ſlothfull, but to the bolde and aduenturous: and it is an opinion approued by all the Philoſophers, that a wiſe man is the framer of his owne fortune: And I know ſome gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which to others alſo are wel inough knowne, vertuous, prudent, and of great deſert, yet for that they haue (as wee ſayde) bin euer colde, and not vrged fortune, nor ſought the honors they deſerued, liue in their Cittie without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume: wherevpon by Court impoſtors, this their modeſty is eſteemed puſillanimitie, not to ſay plain ſtupidity: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, euery day we ſee men of ſmal deſert, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to great honors, by hauing beene audacious, and aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all means, as wel lawfull as vnlawful, but ſpecially in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to themſelues their fauor, that could beſtow on them honor or riches. And if wee do but thinke vpon the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as well of the ancientes, as men of theſe times, we will conclude, that valiant men ought to ſeek, and hunt after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, that they may be known to be the men they are. For beginning from the Romaines, as they were vertuous, &amp; of great valor, ſo did they demaund, and by all meanes affect honors: vnto them, it not ſeeming ſufficient, to deſerue it, except they alſo fiſhed for it: with great ſute therefore they required the Pretorſhips, Conſulſhippes, Pontificacie, all Magiſtracies, &amp; other dignities that appertained to honor, as alſo the Generals of armies or Conſuls were wont, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into their countrie laden with ſpoile of their enemies, with al inſtance to demaund triumph: and oftentimes this beeing denied them, they raiſed ſedition in the common-wealth, which ſurely they would neuer haue doone, but that they knewe, that to ſeeke and hunt after honour, is proper to a vertuous man, and to one that deſerueth:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16643:63"/>and to come to more moderne examples, let vs ſee, whether in the moſt famous Venetian commonwealth, honours and magiſtracie be by the nobility required: in ſuch ſort, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no whit inconuenient for any gentleman whatſoeuer of ſingular vertue, to demaund Magiſtracie, with that theyr maner of ſupplication, which they call <hi>Broio;</hi> and yet for all this are they not counted ambitious, but rather doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they ſhould bee eſteemed loſtie and proude: as if for this receiued honour, they were rather bound to their owne proper vertue, then to thoſe, who graciouſly diſpenſed it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But what neede wee to vſe any more preualent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, do we not reade that the maſter of good cuſtomes, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> himſelf with his followets hauing plucked <hi>Plato</hi> now old, out of his chaire, went and ſate in it himſelf, not reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to diſhonour his maiſter, for the exaltation of himſelfe with that honour, wherof he thought he was worthy? I will not therefore thinke, that to ſeeke honor is any hereſie at all, or a thing vnworthie of a vertuous and wiſe man. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> directeth al his actions to honeſtie, and not to honour, for though there were no honour in the world, yet would he performe honeſt actions, conſidering that humane felicitie conſiſteth in vertuous and honeſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not in honour, as the Philoſopher affirmeth in the ſecond of his Ethikes: nay, and as often as hee ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme honeſt actions, to no other end, but to obtaine honour, and not honeſt reputation, ſuch an action of it ſelfe ſhould neither be vertuous nor worthie of honour. But the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man making ſmall reckoning of honeſty, is hee that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies worketh in fauour of honour, ſeeking that honour which is not conuenient for him, from the place with him not befitting, &amp; with the means for him, no waies requiſite.</p>
            <p>I would haue thought, ſaid <hi>Guirino,</hi> that Honour and Honeſtie haddde beene the ſelfe ſame thing, eſpecially, the Philoſopher hauing placed it amongſt things honeſt, or at leaſt ſo, that the one cannot ſtande without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: in ſuch ſorte, that wee cannot endeuour in fauour
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16643:63"/>of honeſtie, without hauing an eye vnto honour: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he that did attend honor, ſhuld haue regard to honeſty. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> although there is nothing honeſt, which is not alſo worthie of honour, and notwithſtanding honour properly agreeth with things honeſt, yet honour without honeſtie, and honeſtie without honor may be found: for as one may deſerue, and not poſseſſe honour, ſo may he vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily enioy honour that deſerueth it not, conſidering that the poſſeſsion of honour is in the handes of Fortune, and not of vertue, as hath beene ſaid. By the definition of honour replied <hi>Guiring,</hi> it ſeemeth that honour and honeſtie are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable: for if honour be a ſigne of honeſt action, it will follow, that where honour is, there muſt likewiſe be hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, as alſo where honeſtie is, there muſt needes be honour: as (for to vſe the example of <hi>Poſſeuino</hi>) where is the figne, there is the Inne, neither without the ſigne can the Inne ſtand: and where aſhes be, there either is, or hath beene fire, for aſhes is a manifeſt token of fire, as milke is of pregnancy in a woman. If honor (ſaid <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) were as neceſſarie a ſigne of honeſtie, as aſhes of fire, or milke of child quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and pregnancie, this argument would quickly bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but though honour be a ſigne and reward of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, yet it is no neceſſarie token of honeſt action: for it may be honour, though vnworthily, where vertue is not, or vertuous action may ſtand without deſerued honor, when ſhe findeth her ſelfe by fortune abandoned: &amp; to proſequute the example of <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> as many times there be Innes, &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in <hi>Spain,</hi> which haue nothing good in them but the ſigne or garland, that deceiue ſtrangers, ſeeing within there is neither bread nor wine, nor any of thoſe things that are the proper ſuſtentations of an Inne, ſo may diuers be found, that not hauing in themſelues any vertue, poſſeſſe by the ſtroke of blind fortune, the exterior enſigne of vertue, which is honor. But to returne from whence we haue digreſſed, I affirme, that to ſeek poſſeſsion of honor by any other mean, then by the deſert of vertue, is not a thing honeſt nor conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16643:64"/>for a vertuous and good man, ſo that with a quiet mind he ought rather to ſuffer the depriuation therof, then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding it, to manifeſt himſelfe ambitious, and defirous of honor, retaining alwaies in memorie this infallible propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that to require honour, annihilateth the deſert of wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And therefore the Philoſopher in the third of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litikes ſayth, that he who demaundeth magiſtracie, ſhe weth himſelfe rather ambitious, then deſeruing it, and he addeth, that magiſtracies ſhould rather bee giuen to thoſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly refuſe them, then to ſuch as impudently require them: which being true, the modeſtie of thoſe gentlemen, by you and others knowne to be vertuous, ought not to bee taxed, although they liue a priuate life, not practiſing euerie day, after the manner of men ambitious, and that ſhamefully beg honours. But rather that Signior or prince is to be blamed, in whoſe handes it lieth to diſpence rewardes, puniſhments, honours, grace, and fauours. For if hee knoweth not the deſert of euerie ſubiect, but eſpetially of ſuch as bee noble, who of themſelues are worthie to be regarded, he incurreth like blame, as the ſhepheard that knoweth not his ſheep: but if he know them, and yet diſtribute his honors &amp; fauors, to flatterers, ignorant, and preſumtuous men, litle eſteeming the modeſt and vertuous, he ſheweth himſelfe vniuſt, &amp; vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of principality. And touching the example of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, if we meſure wel their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, we ſhal find that in their common-wealth they were rather good citizens, then vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; good men. I would haue thought (ſaide <hi>Guirini</hi>) that a good citizen &amp; an honeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bin al one: And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> In the beſt common-wealth it is al one, becauſe her end is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: but in that common-wealth which preferreth profit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore honeſtie, a good man &amp; good citizen be not al one: And ſuch an one was the Romane common-wealth, ſhee euer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had this ſcope, to ſigniorize ouer others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Romanes, notwithſtanding they were good Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and profitable for the common-wealth, yet ſurelie they were not vertuous nor good men, but rather ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they ſeeking the honour, not of honeſtie, but of profit:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16643:64"/>and that this is true, by a decree of the Senate it may bee prooued, which thus diſpoſed, that triumph ſhould not bee granted, but vpon the augmentation of empire, and not for recouery only of things loſt: as alſo, that no captaine might triumph, if in one battaile only, he had not at the leaſt put ſix thouſand men to the ſword. Whether ſuch an action be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely honeſt, or worthy of honor, I leaue to you to iudge: for my part, I would ſay, that to ſhedde humane bloud, for the wicked deſire of Empire, were an action rather wicked and diſhoneſt than woorthy of honour: which being true, the examples of the Romaines, ought not to remooue vs from our opinion, ſeeing they ambitious, ſought honor, from whence it befitted not, and after a manner no wayes conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: but if they had beene truely good and vertuous, they would neuer with ſute haue demaunded magiſtracie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, being an action much more worthy of an honeſt man with modeſtie to be refuſed, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be accepted of ambitiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly. And to vſe the example of the ſelfe ſame Romaines, tell me in good erneſt, whether of theſe two iudge you to be the honeſter action? That of <hi>Fuluius Flaccus,</hi> who to anoyde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, refuſed triumph, by others ſo much aſpired after: or that of <hi>Q. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alerius,</hi> who blinded with ambition, contended with <hi>Lutatius</hi> about triumph, not reſpecting how it was not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, that a Pretor in triumph ſhould be equall with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul? And which act was more worthy of commendation, that of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> in vſurping the perpetual Dictatorſhip, or the other of the great African, who hauing bin entertained with honors correſpondent to his deſerts, &amp; the Senate determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning further, to erect vnto him an image, where the people vſed to aſſemble, one in the Senate houſe, another in the <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghera,</hi> or place of orations, as alſo to place his image in the Ca pitoll, where were the ſtatues of the gods, adorned with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant ornaments, and further to make him both Conſull and Dictator for terme of life: he neuer would conſent, that any of theſe honours might bee attributed vnto him, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by decree of the Senate, nor voyce of the people.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16643:65"/>ſent that any of theſe honors, might be attributed vnto him, neither by the decree of the Senate, nor voice of the people. Vndoubtedly this valiant man, did no leſſe ſhew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his minde, in refuſing ſo great honors, than before he had done in deſeruing them: whereas on the contrarie, the minde of <hi>Caeſar</hi> puffed vp and full of ambition, by vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the higheſt of all honours, did not alittle obſcure the deſert of his renowmed valour, making him to be knowne, as queſtion leſſe he was, for a man ambitious and wicked.</p>
            <p>Concerning your moderne example, of the Venetian Signiorie, as that moſt noble common-wealth is armed with excellent lawes, ſo is the practiſe of <hi>Broio</hi> (as a courſe ſcarce honeſt) by law forbidden. And about reformation hereof is the office of Cenſorſhip conuerſant: for truth whereof, they graunt no magiſtracie to them, who openly demand it, but to thoſe that are choſen: and therfore, before they create a magiſtrate, they firſt call out by ſcruteny, thoſe that are to haue the election; and he to whoſe lot the golden <hi>Ballot</hi> falles out, is the Elector that propoundeth and nominaceth him, whom he thinketh worthy of the magiſtracie; and that of al he may be knowne for ſuch an one the <hi>Ballotini</hi> go about (for ſo are they called that cary about the box with theſe <hi>Ballots</hi>) declaring with an high voyce, the honours and magiſtracies that before they haue perfourmed. It cannot be denied, ſaid <hi>Guirino,</hi> but that common-wealth gouerned by the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt, is furmſhed with excellent lawes: notwithſtanding the practiſe of <hi>Broio</hi> is ſo inueterate, that there is no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate choſen, but by this meane: as alſo, they praeoccupy to be nominated and elected: yea and openly giue one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tickets of their names, ſurnames, and offices, they haue gone through. This abuſe, aunſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi> is not raſhly permitted, but with great iudgement, ſeeing thereout they reape a benefit, that tendeth to the preſeruation of the common-wealth, conſidering that by this <hi>Broio,</hi> the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is vnited, comoyning themſelues rogether in loue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by this mutuall and interchangeable benefite: and by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16643:65"/>ſurname, knowing one another, they are warie to offend in any caſe: ſo that I aſſure you, thoſe gentlemen, do more feare one of thoſe ragged pelers of paper, then do ſouldiers the leaden bullet of the hargabuſe. Surely I remaine ſatisfied, ſaide <hi>Guirino,</hi> that a vertuous and good man, ought not to proſecute honor, but with deſert of vertue, and vertuous action. And Count <hi>Caeſar Taſſone:</hi> Seeing an honeſt man muſt not ſhew himſelfe ſomuch as deſirous of honor, yet I would willingly vnderſtand, on whether of theſe two hee ought to bee moſt ententiue, ether to receiue honour, or to doe honor to another: for my part I woulde thinke, that honor being a ſigne which ſheweth vertue, an honeſt man, to make himſelfe knowne for the man he is, ought rather to couer by honor amongſt others to be famous, then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to honor another, conſidering that to honor another, ſeemeth a token of ſubmiſsion, and noteth I know not what kinde of ſupereminencie in him honored. A good man, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> ought rather to be carefull in doing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, then in receiuing honor from another, and the reaſon is in readines: for though wee be not honored by another, yet loſe we not the deſert of honor: but on the contrarie, we not honouring thoſe, to whom wee are bound to render ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, we wholy manifeſt our ſelues vniuſt, and vnworthy of honor: Furthermore, to do honor, and eſpecially to him that deſerueth, is an honeſt action, and euer proper to a good man: but in receiuing honor, the honored performeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing honeſt: and notwithſtanding it be a ſigne of vertue in the honored, yet is it no ſuch neceſſary token as wee haue ſaid; for a wicked man may alſo receiue honor, although he be voworthy. <hi>Taſſone</hi> commended this anſwer. When Signior <hi>Franciſco, Patritio:</hi> You ſir Knight haue giuen me but ſmall occaſion to doubt, yet would I willingly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more exquiſitly vnderſtand, how it can be, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor by you termed natural, and as it were imperfect, ſhould be a former diſpoſition to perfect honor, conſidering you explained it from this point very diuers. And <hi>Gualingua</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:16643:66"/>The honour which is our owne, and whereof euery one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth proſeſsion, is out of doubt a former diſpoſition to that honor, which with vertue is acquired: for whoſoeuer want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the good opinion of the worlde, is incapable of all, but eſpecially, of perfect honor, as a liuing thing wanting vertue vegetatiue, cannot haue ſenſe. If perfect honor, ſaid <hi>Patritio,</hi> (for ſo will we call that, which is the reward of vertue) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt without the imperfect, wherefore haue you ſaid that the imperfect honor hath no parte in felicitie, but onely the perfect? Vnperfect honor ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> may be vnderſtode by it ſelfe alone, (as many times we finde it) or elſe as conioyned with that perfect: of it ſelfe alone it hath no part in felicitie, becauſe felicitie dependeth on operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the beſt and moſt perfect vertue: and this is not deriued from excellent operation, but from not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming very vitious action: and therefore it bringeth not with it felicitie, but maketh a man indifferent, neither hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, nor miſerable; but when wee conſider it, as vnited with perfect honor, then we may ſay, that it is a diſpoſition and preparation to felicitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Patritio</hi> was ſatisfied, and Signior <hi>Hercules <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arani,</hi> who hath no ſmall taſte of learning, propounded after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Philoſopher ſheweth in the firſt of his Ethickes, in the place aboue cited, that felicitie is not honour, becauſe felicitie is our owne, and honour is not: and rendring hereof a reaſon, he vſeth theſe formall words: It ſeemeth honour is rather in the performer, than in him that receiueth it. Out of which wordes, ſome moue this queſtion; whither honor, be in the honorer, or honoured: &amp; amongſt others, <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> maketh a large diſcuſsion, concluding that honour, is both in the one and other. In the honorer, becauſe hee dooth his duetie, in honouring him that deſerueth: and in the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as receiuing the reward of vertuous operation. Nowe of this honour wherewith we are borne, you haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed howe it is both in one and other; but of perfect honor we ſtand in doubt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:16643:66"/>And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> It is no leſſe improper, for to ſearch whether this honour, bee in him honouring, or the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than it woulde bee to demaund, whether the Statue were in the Grauer, in the procurer of it to be wrought, or in him whoſe image it repreſenteth: therefore I ſay, that honour as a rewarde, is neither in him honoring, nor the honored. And what ſence will you apply to the wordes of the Philoſopher, replied <hi>Varani?</hi> When <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> The Philoſopher woulde inferre, that honour being no other, than that reward, which ſheweth operation of vertue, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of the giuer, as of the cauſe efficient, which is he honouring, and not of the other honoured, being hee that receiueth it: ſeeing it is in our power to deſerue it, but not to receiue it, as wee haue ſaide: yet to honourable action, hee honoured concurreth in a more eminent manner, than the honorer; in that he thereto concurreth as the ende, hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring performing honor, in fauour of the other honored: but if by this reaſon, honour were formally, both in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norer, and honored, by the contentment, which of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable action, is both in the one and other, as affirmeth <hi>Poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uino,</hi> this would bee falſe which the Philoſopher ſaith, for the contentment of receiuing honour, being greater than of performing it, it would by this meanes come to bee, more in the honored that receiueth, then in the honorer, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth it. And how can it be added <hi>Varano,</hi> that in receiuing there ſhould be greater contentment, than in perfourming, conſidering (as the ſame <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> affirmeth) that it is a thing more excelent to do, than ſuffer: but he that receiueth ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth? This propoſition alſo of <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> is falſe, ſpeaking abſolutely, for being alwayes true, it would follow that the creature in reaſonable action were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Creator. But to the end we erre not in this, it muſt be obſerued, that to giue, and receiue, is conſidered two manner of wayes: one, when wee performe or giue ſimply in honeſty, without hauing receiued, or ſo much as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for any benefit. And in this kind, it is much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16643:67"/>to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to receiue, and the contentment of him that giueth, is much more, then of the other that receiueth, for in the giuer, abundance appeareth, but in the receiuer, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The other kind is, when we giue in recompence of a receiued benefit, &amp; eſpecially the reward of Vertue, which is the honour of this world: and in this reſpect vndoubtedlie it is a matter of greater excellence to receiue then giue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it noteth aboundance of perfection in the receiuer, and want in him that giueth: and ſo conſequently, it is a greater contentment to receiue after this maner, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue: conformable to which our opinion, the Philoſopher in the ſecond of his Rhetorick, ſaith: The performer of a benefit is much more ioyfull in beholding him benefited, then is the receiuer in ſeeing his benefactor: and to conclude, by howe much the cauſe finall is more noble and excellent then the efficient, ſo much more excellent is it to receiue, then to giue honour.</p>
            <p>And therefore the moſt mightie God concurreth with honour, as of all other things the moſt eminent, being the end, in fauour whereof all things do moue. Signior <hi>Hercules</hi> approoued this anſwere: and Signior <hi>Franceſco <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa,</hi> thus propounded: You, ſir knight, haue defined honour vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to be the moſt precious of all goods externall, which being true, it would follow, that Praiſe, Honour, Glory, and Fame, ſhould be the ſelfe ſame things ſignified by theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers names, or being different, your propoſition would bee falſe, for glorie is much more eſteemed then honour, which ſeemeth to be moſt precious, as that which onely agreeth with God. And <hi>Gualin:</hi> Your doubt Signior <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa,</hi> is no leſſe excellent and gracious then your ſelfe, wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing it, I ſay, that if wee conſider the foundation, and from whence they take their originall, praiſe, honour, and glory, be the ſelf ſame things, neither doth one in perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exceed another, ſeing al of them are grounded vpon vertue, and from her are deriued. And therfore the Romans ſo ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togither the Temple of Vertue and Honour, as to the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16643:67"/>Temple of Honor one could not paſſe, vnleſſe firſt he wen by that of Vertue: but if we conſider theſe termes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they are of diuers ſignification: for ſpeaking proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we praiſe habites and vertues, but attribute honour to the actions that of vertue depend, and glorie to the excellence of vertue and actions togither: diſtinguiſhing therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of theſe termes, we wil affirm, that praiſe is a ſpeech, which ſheweth and exalteth another mans vertue, the which in two ſorts is afforded, with liuely voyce, and in writing, as alſo by poeſie: and this by the Graecian is called <hi>Encomion,</hi> and hath his place with honour permanent: Glorie, the faithfull heire as it were, of Praiſe, is no other but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and approoued opinion, of another mans excellent vertue and Heroycall acts, and from honour is different, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this, without any other ſigne or reward, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in memory with men, through infinit ages. Fame, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it ſeeme the ſame that is Glorie, that alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a publike rumour, that bringeth forth vniuerſall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet is it from Glorie different, firſt, becauſe ſhee in one inſtant hath her ſorce, and many times is falacious: but Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is euer firme, as not framed but with long time. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, glorie is alwaies taken in good parte, Fame ſometimes well, otherwhiles euill, whereupon wicked men alſo are ſaide to be famous: and therefore Fame of <hi>Virgill</hi> is deſcribed, to be an horrible monſter, then which there is nothing more ſwift. It ſeemeth alſo that Fame agreeth moſt with the dead, but Glorie belongeth alſo to the liuing. For the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Philoſophers, and great Captaines, nowe long ſince dead, are ſayd by Fame to be exalted to the ſtarres, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the liuing alſo enioy.</p>
            <p>Signior <hi>Villa</hi> was pleaſed with this anſwer, and the Ladie <hi>Tarq. Molza</hi> drawing neare, a woman of moſt pregnant capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, ſeeing how in that noble aſſembly there was not anie, who would further propound with the fauor of the Queen, ſpoke after this ſort: It appeareth Sir knight, that you haue handled this argument of honour, in fauour onely of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16643:68"/>men, as though women therein, had no part at al: ſeeing al thoſe aduertiſements by which honor is preſerued, do in a manner pertaine altogether to men, and little or nothing to women; becauſe for my part I will not be of opinion, that a woman looſeth her honor, if with her proper valor ſhe repel not iniurie, or fight not for her Countrie, Prince, children, or husband, performing other ſuch like actions, as belong vnto fortitude. Forbeare not therefore to inſtruct women, how they may preſerue their honor: And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in women, moſt gentle Lady, all thoſe vertues are found, which proportionally are correſpondent to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of men, notwithſtanding it ſeemeth, that for preſeruing their honor, theyr condition is farre better then mens: for Honor feminine is preſerued by not failing onely in one of their proper particular vertues, which is honeſtie. If a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man therefore, replied Lady <hi>Tarquinia,</hi> ſhould committe a theſt, manſlaughter, or faile in any other part of Iuſtice, ſhould ſhe not for ſuch a fact be infamous? And <hi>Gualenguo:</hi> Although ſuch offences, in men and women, are by the laws equally puniſhed, yet as often as in a woman they are not accompanied with the act of diſhoneſtie, they make her not infamous. Therefore it was not lawfull with the Hebrewes nor Romaines, to refuſe their wiues, as alſo at this day the ſeperation of mariage bed is not permitted, but for crime of diſhoneſtie, ſeeing in a woman, this offence is ſo grieuous, as with her owne, ſhee ſtaineth alſo the honour of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>This is a great matter you acqaint me withal, added <hi>Molza,</hi> neither can I perceiue how it may bee, the definition of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, remaining firme, wherein you conclude, that honor is loſt through our own, and not for anothers defect: the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie therefore of the wife, being of a wife the defect and offence, and not of her husband, ſhe only ought therefore to bee infamous.</p>
            <p>The wife, anſwered <hi>Gua.</hi> beeing in her husbands power, and vnder his gouernment, it appereth ſhee cannot offend,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16643:68"/>without ſome fault in her husband, as he that either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or euill gouernment, hath beene the occaſion of ſuch a defect: and therefore it cannot bee that the adulterous wife, ſhould not in ſome part offend her husbands honour, becauſe ſuch a man, cannot bee in that good opinion hee firſt was, with them who haue notice of this offence, for they iudge him ignorant, of ſmall worth, and worthy of that contempt his wife and adulterer procure him. And if the husband, ſaide <hi>Molza,</hi> knewe not the adulterie of his wife, but had thereof all the conuenient care hee might, and yet for all this, his wife ſhould bee ſo malitious, as hee not ware thereof, to ſet a creaſt on his head: ſhould the husband for this loſe his honour?</p>
            <p>A man not beeing able, anſwered <hi>Gualenguo,</hi> to auoide all ſnares and deceits, nor to preuent thoſe thinges, whereof he hath no knowledge, ſhould not altogether looſe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, notwithſtanding, it could not otherwiſe in ſome ſorte be, but that he ſhould be touched, and ſhake his reputation with thoſe men, who were acquainted with his wiſes adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: yet could he not in compariſon of honor be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt, vnleſſe it were prooued, that he tollerated his wifes diſhoneſtie, for ſome benefit he hoped for in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, or through folly; ſuffering her to go into places diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, or to conuerſe with women of euill name, or where there were daunger that ſhee might committe adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie; for certainly hee is a foole, that putteth fire to towe and thinketh it ſhoulde not burne.</p>
            <p>To retourne therefore to our purpoſe, a woman deſirous to preſerue her honor, ought to haue an eye to preſerue her honeſtie, and not onely to bee free from offence, but alſo from ſuſpition of offence: the which ſhee ſhall conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently doo, if ſhee accompanie her wordes, laughter, lookes, and carriage of her perſon, with that graue and reuerent maieſtie, as is beſeeming a chaſte and modeſt Matrone, and aboue all, to auoide the familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16643:69"/>of any man, be his condition whatſoeuer, except her father, ſonne, and brother: For honor hauing his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and proper eſſence in the opinion of the worlde, it is not ſo much loſt for offence, as by probable preſumptions of offending, With this aunſwere, by the Queene commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and by all theſe moſt chaſte and vertuous Ladies confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they ended the diſcourſe of honor; and the Lady <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Peuerara</hi> was called, who with ſingular delight to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, ſung vnto the Harpe an amorous Sonnet. But the court and huutſmen arriued, the Queene &amp; company retired them ſelues into the lodging of the Ducheſſe, where, with diuerſe entertainements they ſpent the time while Supper; which finiſhed, and certaine dances exerciſed, the night being wel ſpent, the Duke roſe vp, and referring ouer his fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the day following they all betooke themſelues to their reſt.</p>

Signior <hi>Gualinguo</hi> was ſet downe by himſelfe alone, al melancholy, leaning his cheek on his hand: which Count <hi>Alfonſo Turchi</hi> perceuing, as he who is deſirous to vnderſtand (eſpecially ſuch matters as appertaine to knighthoode) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to count <hi>Scandiano,</hi> count <hi>Hercules Beuelacqua,</hi> and count <hi>Guido Calcagnini,</hi> who ſtood beholding at a window the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſea: Let vs go, ſaide he, to Signior <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> who ſitteth there altogither idle, and procure we him to diſcourſe a little more particularly touching Honour and Combate. For although yeſterday, he entreated thereof, yet ſtoode he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16643:70"/>altogether vpon generalities, not extending himſelfe greatly to particulars, which in my opinion, are of no ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This motion wel pleaſed the other three Gentlemen, it ſeeming vnto them, that they could not ſpend the day in more pleaſing or profitable entertainement. Approaching therefore neare <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> ſir knight, ſaid Count <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> if we be importunate, blame your owne vertue, and the deſire wee haue to vnderſtand: Yeſter euening in fauour of the Queene, to our great benefit and contentment, you made it knowne, that there were two honors, in themſelues diuerſe, the one of which might be called perfect, grounded vpon an opinion, for the moſt part falſe; and the other truly perfect, as grounded vpon true apparant valour, and vpon the moſt excellent of all vertuous operations. To day ſeeing the time forcibly keepeth vs in the houſe, we deſire, that in fauour of your ſelfe, you wil diſcourſe of combate: for thoſe who write of combat, not hauing diſtinctly known the nature of honor, doubtleſle, they haue not thereof ſincerely intreated.</p>
            <p>Although to this houre, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> there hath not any written ſufficiently of Combate, and that for this, many abuſes haue bene introduced into the Titles of honor; yet in this, neither I can, or ought to giue you ſatisfaction: firſt, becauſe the Treatiſe thereof is ſuperfluous, Combate nowe being no more in vſe, but remooued out of chriſtian commonwealths, by Popes and chriſtian Princes, as a thing certainely, I will not ſay barbarous, (in that amongſt Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians wee neuer finde it accuſtomed) but impious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: ſecondarily, as a man expreſsing the trueth, I neyther can nor ought to dilate, but in diſcommendation of it, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the vanitie of Doctour <hi>Paris</hi> de <hi>Puteo,</hi> and <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> that it is vniuſt, and worthy to be wholly baniſhed out of the commonwealth, as a deſtroyer of humane felicity; if you wil not according to our deſire, ſaid <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> diſcourſe thereof, at the leaſt yet, may it pleaſe you, by vs demanded, to anſwer to thoſe points, wherein we do doubt, &amp; haue not vnderſtanding. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> I wil not refuſe to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16643:70"/>and reſolue you to my power, if you ſhoulde thereof haue any wrong or ſiniſter opinion. You intreating of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, added Count <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> ſayde, that Combate was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded vppon that honour, wee bring with vs from our mothers wombe, and whereof euery one maketh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, it beeing honour imperfect: and that it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with that honour which is a parte or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of felicitie. Of this I ſtand in doubt: For beſides that <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> holdeth the contrary, hee grounding Combate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that honour which is a ſigne of beneficent opinion: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then this, alſo it ſeemeth there is ſome reaſon, that a man in combate, putting his life to compromiſe, ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to expoſe it for honour perfect, than imperfect: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially perfect honour, being part of felicitie, vnto which, as to his proper end man directeth all his operations. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> What I told you yeſterday is true, that Combate hath not to do with that honor, which is a part of felicitie, &amp; reward of beneficence: the which I will make you conceiue, by the definition it ſelfe of Combate, which in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be ſuch: Combate is a bartaile betwixt twoo of equall intereſt, in ſome poynt of honor, in the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the vanquiſhed incurreth infamy, and the victor remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth poſſeſſed of Honour: Wee hauing therefore ſhewed that infamie is not contrary, to perfect honour, which with valour is acquired, it followeth that the honour in Combate debated, neyther is, nor can bee perfect honour: but that honour, which is proper contrary to infamy.</p>
            <p>This alſo is made manifeſt by the two meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with quarrels are proteſted: For hee which challengeth, called therefore the Aſſailant, offereth to proue vpon him chalenged, who in this reſpect is termed Defendant, that he hath committed ſome of thoſe offences, that depriue of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and that therefore he is infamous: in the other kinde, the aſſailant offereth to proue himſelfe a man of honor, and that hee is vnwoorthy of the iniury and contempt, which the Defendant hath offered him, being as much as if he ſhoulde
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16643:71"/>ſay, that he would proue vpon him, that himſelfe neuer fail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> in iuſtice, nor honor. For by ſuch defects a man commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt: and to ſtand vpon vſe and cuſtome, wee neuer do, nor ſhall finde, that any quarrels haue beene vndertaken, about perfect honor, or that any for this haue come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: for certainely it woulde bee a ridiculous matter, if any ſhould offer to proue, that he is a man, worthy of a ſtatue, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, crowne, a publike gift, to be reuerenced, giuen place vnto, celebrated with hymnes, or honored with ſuch like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, as alſo it would be as far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaſon, for a man to proue one infamous, not becauſe he had offended, but in that hee neuer receiued any of thoſe honors by me recited. And to an ſwer that you ſpake touching <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> I know not how he came to be ſo blinde, as hauing defined honor, and entreated thereof, as the reward and ſigne of beneficence, he afterward hath ſo vnaduiſedly thereupon grounded Combate, minding that the honor contended vpon, within the liſtes, ſhould bee that, which is the reward of beneficence, neither can wee ſay, that he intended it by any other honor: for beſides that in all his booke he hath not diſcuſſed or knowne any other honor but this, which is a part and proper condition of felicitie; he yet further in the beginning of the fift Booke manifeſteth himſelfe cleerely, ſaying that the honor, which is the end of Combate, is explaned and defined in that part of Politickes which handleth Cuſtoms; and that therefore the Treatiſe of Combate, is a matter pertaining to the Moraliſt, and not to the Ciuilian: and why might not this honor ſaide count <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo Turchi,</hi> be the reward of the victor in the liſtes? conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to ſuch a one after victorie, great honors were done, he being accompanied out of the field, with ſound of drum and trumpet, and denounced valorous of all men: and finally, the armes hung vp in the church, wherewith he had fought, to the perpetual glory of ſuch a fact: which armes, after the nature of a ſtatue, repreſented the image of the victors valor. Relying on the definition of perfect honor, ſaid <hi>Gual:</hi> by vs recited, &amp; by the ſame <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> confirmed, after <hi>Aristotles</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16643:71"/>it cannot be the reward of the victor in the liſtes; for he performeth no act of beneficence, but to himſelfe, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing his enemie: but rather in reſpect of the world, he performeth a worke of maleficence, and therefore is worthy of blame: becauſe hee offendeth the life and honour of his neighbour, and depriueth the common wealth of a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.</p>
            <p>And touching thoſe, which you tearme honors within the lifts theſe be no true houors, in that they neither are, nor can be the rewards of beneficence, as alſo it is no perfect honor, to hang vp our armes in the church of God: firſt becauſe he that is conqueror, not to himſelfe, but to the glorie of God hangeth them vppe: and though he had done it in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of himſelfe, yet could this be no honor vnto him, in that, though by our ſelues, we may be made worthy of honor, yet of our ſelues, as we haue proued, wee cannot bee honored: for then it would follow, that for the ſelfe ſame reſpect, and at the ſelfe ſame time, one may be both honorer and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is impoſsible: I hauing many times conſidered, ſaide Count <hi>Guido,</hi> of hanging vp in the Temples the armes of the Champions in combate, dedicating them to God: I could not but with wonder reſt ſcandalized with ſo great an abuſe, eſpecially God in his holy law, hauing commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that menquellers, ſhould be remoued from his aultar; for what thing could be more impious, and prophane, then to preſent before God the vniuſt ſword, all begoared and tainted in humane bloud, and which before had deſtroied the image of God, and diſpearſed the honor and life of his neighbour. The holy Ghoſt euer be praiſed, who yet in the end hath vouchſafed, to breath vppon the ſoules of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes, and hath remoued vniuſt combate, which was the occaſion of ſo many euils. queſtionleſſe it was a ſingular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, proceeding from the diuine bountie and goodneſſe of God (ſaide Count <hi>Hercules</hi>) to root out of the world ſo great an abuſe. But to returne to <hi>Poſſeuino.</hi> of whom ſometimes, I was wont to be enamoured, I now know, that there can no
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16643:72"/>excuſe bee found, but that, his error is to be blamed: ſeeing it is manifeſtly proued by the ſelfe ſame definition, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth, of Combate, that the honour contended of in the liſtes, is not that honour hee defined, and whereof in his booke, hee hath intreated, which definition hee ſetteth downe with farre greater circumſtances, then you do yours, wherfore of neceſſitie either yours muſt be defectiue, or his ſuperaboundant, he affirming combate to bee a voluntarie encounter, betwixt two men, by which the one armed onte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to proue vpon the other, by his owne proper valor, not therein any way hindred, and in the ſpace of a day, that he is an honorable man, and not worthie to be contemned, nor iniuried: as alſo the other hath a determination to proue the contrarie. Out of doubt by theſe laſt words in this definition, it cannot be entended by perfect honor, and by beneficent actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acquired, ſeeing he mindeth not to proue, that he hath performed any great benefite, that he is worthy of a ſtatue, crowne, or ſome other ſuch like reward: except peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Poſſeuinos</hi> minde was, or that he ſuppoſed, the man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of contempt, to be alſo worthie of the rewarde of beneficence. Notwithſtanding <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> anſwered <hi>Gualin:</hi> endeuoreth to ſhew, that this his definition, is moſt perfect, as in it being nothing ſuperfluous or improper, and that it might be a perſpicuous beginning to the vnderſtanding of all thinges, that appertaine to combat: yet to himſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch affected, he is deceiued, for hee hath praepoſtered it with words ſuperfluous, defectiue, and improper.</p>
            <p>Now in all affection, ſir Knight I beſeech you (ſaid Count <hi>Alfonſo</hi>) be it not vnto you diſpleaſing, to examine this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition by points and parcels, to the end, we may vnderſtand the truth, for I for my part euer iudged, that <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> by this definition had better expreſſed the nature of combate, then any other, that hitherto had written. Beginning at the firſt worde (anſwered <hi>Gua.</hi>) encounter or conflict, wherof in this definition, he maketh a generall vſe: it is not a worde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but tranſlated; for it is drawne from hewing down trees,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16643:72"/>ouerthrowing houſes, walles, towres, and ſuch like: and it is a thing certaine (as the Philoſopher teacheth) that tranſlated or metaphoricall wordes, as we call them, are not apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the eſſence of things: and therſore they ſhould neuer be placed in definitions, eſpecially, when there bee wordes proper to ſerue the turne: and although without preiudice to truth, we ſhould grant, that it were not a word tranſlated, yet could he not denie, that he, when he might haue placed in his definition, a kinde more neare, hath vſed one more v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal and remote, conſidering that conflict or encounter, is much more remote and vniuerſall, then is their word battaile, ſeeing euery battaile may bee ſaide to bee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, but yet euery conflict may not bee a battaile: except <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> were of opinion, that to ouerthrowe walles, trees, houſes, or ſuch like thinges, were to be tearmed a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. Houing therefore in this definition placed the kinde remote, for that nearer to the nature of the thing, it ſeemeth he made but ſmall accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his maiſters precepts in his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke; and the error he hath committed, is no leſſe, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to define man, he hath defined him for a creature, and not for a reaſonable ſubſtance. But for all this he ſheweth, replied Count <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> with iudgement to haue ſet downe theſe wordes: ſaying: from hence wee may gather that all both wiſe and ignorant, doe call ſuch an encounter or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict if we ſo pleaſe, Combate? Although this be falſe (ſaid <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) as I will ſhewe you, yet admit it were true, that Combate ordinarily were called a conflict, it ſhould not for all this bee ſet downe in the definition of Combate, this beeing a worde tranſlated improper, and inſufficient, to diſtinguiſh the nature of Combate: For as authoritie coupled with reaſon, maketh great proofe, ſo of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon abandoned, it is inſufficient, neither ſhall wee euer finde, that the Philoſopher without reaſon hath preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by authoritie: but this is farre from truth, that ſuch a like battaile, is by all men called a conflict: And beginning with excellent Doctor <hi>Paris de puteo,</hi> who is the ancienteſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16643:73"/>and of greateſt authoritie, he calleth combate a ſingle bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and neuer termeth it an encounter or conflict, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Mutio Iuſtinopolitano</hi> ſometimes hath named it a conflict, yet when heasſigneth the proper deſinitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he ſaieth, that combate is a battaile, of body to body, for proofe of truth: and <hi>Arioſto</hi> ſpeaking of battaile hand to hand, calleth it not an encounter, or conflict, but ſingle fight, ſaying:
<q>Fine, or ſix dayes, this ſingle fight deferred was.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And that which followeth: by this authoritie, one may vnderſtand, that <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> hath erred in ſaying, that both the wiſe, and ignorant, call combate a conflict: but rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of iudgement, hauing an eye to the latine, which ſaieth, ſingle fight: and to the Greeke which tearmeth it <hi>Monomachia,</hi> ſignifying the ſelfe ſame, will define it a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and not a conflict. But to come to that other word vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie, it is ſuperfluous, improperly placed, and not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, as he affirmeth, to diſtinguiſh a battaile made by force &amp; in this point, he hath no better vſed Ariſtotles doctrine, then before in other places he hath done. But how is it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, replied Count <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> are there not many that fight by conſtraint? It is ſuperfluous (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) becauſe without it, the definition may ſtand, ſeeing ſuch a chance can neuer happen, that two combatantes within the liſtes ſhould fight, by force, in that manner hee ſpeaketh of; and alwaies when there is a battaile, it is ſuppoſed to be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie; but further, he hath vſed this word voluntarie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, in hauing applied it abſolutely; for although com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate be Voluntary, yet is it not abſolutely volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary, but hath euer mixed with it ſome circumſtance, not voluntarie. I reſt altogether perplexed (ſaide Count <hi>Alfonſo</hi>) neither can I imagine, how combate ſhould be, either voluntarie, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. To manifeſt this vnto you (returned <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) and withall, to diſcouer the error of <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> it is neceſſary, that I giue you diſtinctly to vnderſtand, what actions bee abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely voluntary, and what not voluntary, and which mixed,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16643:73"/>that is which haue ioyned with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a little force or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint: and this I will do the more willingly, in that all this I am to tell you, wilbe no ſmal asſiſtance, to the vnderſtanding of vertuous operations: for no action can be tearmed vertuous, or vitious, worthie of honor, or deſeruing blame, demeriting reward, or puniſhment, if it be not abſolutely voluntarie.</p>
            <p>I affirme therefore that to be abſolutely volumarie, ſeuen conditions are required, as the Philoſopher very well tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in his Moralles; the firſt is, that the beginning be in him that worketh, and not external or without him: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that he vnderſtand his owne action: the third, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what, or for what cauſe he worketh: the ſift, after what ſorte: the ſixt, to what end, that is, in fauour of whom: the laſt, that he performe ſuch an action, voluntarily, and not with griefe: whenſoeuer therefore, any of theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall faile, out of doubt the action, cannot abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be termed voluntarie, but ſhal either, not be voluntary, or retaine with it, ſome part or circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of conſtraint. Help my vnderſtanding (ſaid Count <hi>Alfonſo</hi>) with ſome example, to the end I may better comprehend theſe circumſtaunces of abſolutely voluntarie. And <hi>Gua.</hi> behold an example, we may commit an error, not vnderſtanding the matter, as hee doth, that putteth away a falſe crown eſteeming it good: this action may be tearmed not voluntarie, for if he had knowne ſo much, being an honeſt man, he would not haue ſpent it: and therefore is worthie of pardon, and not of puniſhment: In like ſort we may erre, not knowing the matter, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what wee worke, as if one ſhould offend his Father, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming him an enemie, in ſuch maner as vnhappy <hi>Oedipus</hi> did: wee may likewiſe erre by not knowing the inſtrument wherewith wee worke, as if one ſhould ſtrike with a ſpeare, beleeuing it to be without a head, or with a marble ſtone, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for a pumix: Fiftly wee erre about the maner how: as if one thinking to ſtrike ſoftly, ſhoulde ſmite hard. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we erre concerning the end, &amp; of all other errors it is the greateſt, as if a Phiſition to heale his patient, ſhould lance
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16643:74"/>an impoſtume, and by ſuch inciſion procure him to die: laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that action is not abſolutely voluntary, but hath ſomwhat not voluntary mixt with it: when one worketh hauing know lege of al the circumſtances aboue named, &amp; yet inforced, &amp; with grief, performs ſuch an action, as it hapneth to him, who to ſaue his life, caſteth his goods into the ſea. Now by abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute voluntary, we may conceiue that, not voluntary, which is in two maners: that is, by force or ignorance: by force is that, when the beginning of the action conſiſteth not in the performer, but is extrinſecall and without him, as if one tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my arme by force, ſhould ſtrike another therewith: and therefore this action is violent, becauſe the actor conſenteth not thereunto, neither as agent nor patient: by ignorance is he, that worketh, not knowing any of thoſe circumſtances by me recited: and this, though alwayes it be not voluntary, yet is it not euer vnwillingly performed, but ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that they be performed both voluntarily, and not. How can it be, ſaid count <hi>Guydo,</hi> that one thing may be, not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, &amp; yet Voluntarily acted. When after an operation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ignorantly, replied <hi>Gualin.</hi> there inſueth not griefe, or repentance, but rather ioy and contentment, that is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction not voluntary, voluntarily performed: as if one ſhould ſhoot an arrow, where he thought ſome wilde beaſt lay hid, and with this ſhould kil his enemy there in couert, it might be ſaid, that this man vnwillingly, had voluntarily ſlaine him, he after the fact remaining ioyful, and wel ſatisfied; but when repentance followeth ſuch operations, in ſuch a caſe they are not voluntary, and againſt wil performed. There be other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which (as I haue ſaid) be termed mixed, becauſe they haue annexed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſome reſpects voluntary, ſom not volun tary: for voluntary they are, as not being performd by force.</p>
            <p>For the beginning of the action is in the actor, who is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy to the circumſtances by me rehearſed; but yet haue ſome conſideration in them of not voluntary, inſomuch, as they are performed for feare of greater ill, or for hope of ſome good, &amp; ſo vnwillingly performed: being ſuch actions as no man of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16643:74"/>ſound minde woulde vndertake: as if a tyrant hauing in his power, the father or children of ſome one, ſhould command him to performe ſom infamous fact, with this condition, that performing it, his father and children ſhould be free, and on the contrary not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhing it, they ſhuld be put to death. The like is as I ſaid by them, who for feare of ſhipwrack, caſt out their goodes: for ſimply there is no man, that of his own proper will, caſteth away his goodes: this granted, wee may eaſily conceiue, that this word voluntary, placed by <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> in his definition of Combate, cannot be intended by abſolute voluntarines, as himſelfe (it ſeemeth) vnderſtands it: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in him that fighteth, the internal beginning of ſuch an action conſiſteth, &amp; that it is not performed by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet hath it ſome circumſtance of not voluntary annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it: firſt, becauſe it is done for feare of greater euill, as would be the loſſe of honor, which the profeſſor therof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth before his own life: ſecondly, in that no man of right ſenſe, would chuſe to put his life, honor, &amp; ſoul, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>promiſe, as combatants do within the liſts. <hi>Poſſ.</hi> hath erred, by impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly placing this word voluntarily in his definition; neither can this alegation excuſe him, that he put it in, for difference of conflict made by force; ſeeing all conflicts are forcibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted after the ſame maner I haue declared, they beeing performed for feare of greater euil: but if he meant to place it as a difference, of violent, &amp; not voluntary; which is of that when the beginning of operation conſiſts not in the actor, it would be ſuperfluous, for ſuch an inſtance can not be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in combatants within the liſts: vnleſſe <hi>Poſſeu.</hi> meant that the wind ſhuld face to face blow the combatants one againſt an other with their armes, the one by the other to be bruſed. But proceeding further, after hee hath ſaid, that combate is a voluntarie incounter or conflict, he addeth: wherein one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to proue vpon another, that he is an honorable man, and vnworthy to be iniuried or contemned; as likewiſe the other mindeth to prooue the contrary.</p>
            <p>In this laſt clauſe there be two errors; firſt, that there being
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16643:75"/>two kindes of quarrelles, for which the aſſailant, chalengeth combate, he hath made mention, only of one: the ſecond is, that he hath improperly placed this word, to prooue, in the perſon of the defendant, which is proper to the aſſailant. I would haue thought, ſaid the Count of <hi>Scandiano,</hi> that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relles had not beene onely of two ſortes, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite, for which men fight: Although the quarrelles may be infinite, anſwered <hi>Gualenguo,</hi> that procure combate, yet are they all reduced to two heades, as likewiſe iniurie and impeaching another mans honor, be of two ſortes: for iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is either committed in words or deeds: in iniury of deeds, the aſſailant being euer the partie iniuried, he entendeth to prooue vpon the defendant, that he is an honorable man, and vnworthy to be contemned: and ſo conſequently, that the defendant, in offending him, hath carried himſelfe, as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt and wicked man; the defendant minding to maintaine the contrary. In the iniurie of wordes, the Aſſailant is for the moſt part him iniurying, who by the iniuried repelled with a lie, is inforced to auerre his ſaying: and therefore he entendeth to aprooue vppon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, that he hath failed in iuſtice or valor, and that hee deſerueth not to bee in the number of men honourable, the defendant determining to mantaine the contrarie: Yet <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> in his definition comprehendeth not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond manner, which reſpecteth the iniurie of wordes, but onely the firſt, hauing relation to iniurie in deedes, and therefore in this point is defectiue. The vſing of this worde. To proue, in the perſon of the defendant, was no leſſe error, ſaide Count <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> becauſe vnto the aſsai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant it is ſo proper, as that there haue beene ſome (whoſe opinion notwithſtanding I do not commend) who ſetting downe precepts for the forming of billes, haue aduiſed the defendantes, that in anſwering, they ſhould not vſe this worde, to prooue, becauſe by this meanes, of defendants, they ſhould make themſelues aſſailantes, and bee preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the election of armes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:16643:75"/>Although after a confuſed maner, ſaid the count <hi>Scandiano,</hi> I vnderſtand theſe termes, Aſſailant, and Defendant, yet I deſire to haue of them more full and ample knowledge, as alſo wherefore to prooue, is proper to the aſſailant, and to ſuſtaine and maintaine to the defendant: Theſe termes (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) are taken out of the ciuil lawe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee that demandeth and mooueth ſtrife, is named the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant, and the chalenged Defendant: So that in Combate the challenger is called, Aſſailant, and he challenged Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: And as by the Ciuil law, it concerneth him Plaintife, to prooue by teſtimony or writings wherefore hee pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to vſurpe the Defendaunts goodes: So in Combate it belongeth to the Aſſailant, to proue wherefore he vſurpeth the Defendants honor: And therefore it is neceſſary that the firſt prouocation proceede from the Aſſailant, in aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Defendant, to which Defendant as a Caſtell, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to ſuſtaine the aſſault: wherefore as well in combat, as in ciuill lawe, the ſtate of the Defendant, is better than of the Aſſailant: in that the Aſſailant not ſubduing, looſeth, and the Defendant not looſing, ouercommeth. It ſeemeth further, ſaide Count <hi>Guido,</hi> that <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> thought it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to inſert this word Armes, in the definition of combate, ſaying: that the one wil prooue by Armes, and as foloweth: whereof I am doubtfull, eſpecially by the Lombards lawe, who were the authors of combate, ſeeing they allow not, that the Combatants ſhoulde vſe other armes in Combate, than ſtaues, and if armes were graunted, this was onely in quarrels that imported ſome offence againſt the maieſtie of the Prince. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> If <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> by armes intendes onely thoſe which are made of yron, or ſteele, which cutte, pricke, and kill, out of doubt, it is ſuperfluous, ſeeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch armes quarrels may be ended, and an enemie van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, within the liſts. It ſee meth, ſaide Count <hi>Hercules Beuelacqua</hi> that hee expreſſeth himſelfe, becauſe he ſaith, he putte in armes in that definition, for the difference betwixt them, and proofe of teſtimony, &amp; other means, as with fiſtes,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16643:76"/>buffetting, and other ſuch like offences, which are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed combate: In my opinion alſo that other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is not neceſſarie, but rather ſuperfluous (in the ſpace of one day) ſaying, that the aſſailant in the ſpace of a day mindeth to proue, that he is a man of honor. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that ſuperfluous, ſaid Count <hi>Alfonſo;</hi> would you that there ſhould be no end of the defendants fighting? And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> Queſtionleſſe, it is ſuperfluous, for though they ſhould fight out the battaile, till one were ſlaine, (which ſometimes, by conſent of the defendant, they do) yet could it not therefore be ſaide, that ſuch a battaile were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> ſaid <hi>Turcho,</hi> in the beginning of his fift and laſt booke of Honor, moueth a queſtion, which hath, and will euer bee readye to procure diſputation amongſt the curious, and that is, whether the treatie of combate, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to militarie diſcipline, to politicall cuſtomes, or to the wiſdome of the lawes: and finally it ſeemeth, that with moſt effectuall reaſons hee concludeth, that the treatie thereof properly appertaineth to politicke cuſtomes, and morrall philoſophy, being altogether alienate from profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the law, and ſouldiers: and our countrie man <hi>Pigna,</hi> was of the ſame opinion, as he affirmeth in his booke intit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of honor, and men heroicall. Touching this alſo I would willingly vnderſtand your minde, that relying on <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> and <hi>Pigna</hi> I continue not ſtill deceiued, as I was wont. In very deed, ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> you ſhould bee deceiued, if you entred into any ſuch opinion, for politick cuſtomes neither, can, nor ought in any ſort, to entreat of combate, combate being a thing vniuſt, &amp; contrary to their foundations. <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuino,</hi> replied <hi>Turcho,</hi> doth yet by liuely reaſons ſhew, that combate hath relation to politicke cuſtomes, as that which intreateth of iniuries, and determineth honour, which is the ende of Combate; for combate is ordained to no other end, but to repel iniuries, and recouer honor: and more, by politicke cuſtomes, we conceiue, who is honorable, and who not, as who is iniuried, and who not: and not by the policy of lawes, and magiſtrates, which diſcuſſe not of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16643:76"/>vices, honor, or felicitie: but ſuppoſing all theſe thinges, with good lawes, &amp; feare of puniſhment, enforce malicious, &amp; ignorant men, to liue according to vertue. By that I haue otherwiſe ſaid, anſwered <hi>Gualin.</hi> in the diſcourſe of honour, as alſo by that I am to declare vnto you, it will bee an eaſie matter to conceiue the ſophiſtications of <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firous to entreat of combate, with morral foundations, and according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is fallen into a ſea of errors, &amp; manifeſt contradictions, giuing to vnderſtand, without other additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that combat is no point of morall diſcipline, as it is onely moral: for the morall Philoſopher hauing felicitie for his ſcope, as he which entendes no other courſe, but to ſhew the meanes whereby a man may become happy, cannot diſpoſe of theſe things which are contrarie to felicitie, except by the ſame meanes he conſidereth of vice, that is, as of a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be diſcommended, and by them altogether to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded which deſire humane felicitie: neither preuaileth it to ſay, that moral philoſophie defineth that honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon combat is grounded, for I haue proued vnto you, that the Moraliſt conſidereth nothing at all, nor neuer defineth this honor wherevpon combate is grounded, but onely that, which by beneficent action is acquired: fot this by waye of combat can neither be acquired, or preſerued, as he fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth, as alſo it were to ſmall purpoſe to ſay, that by Ethicks wee knowe, who is honorable, and who not: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be tru, yet is it not to be vnderſtood by that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, wherof euery one maketh profeſſion; but by that, which to a few is participated, being the reward of excellent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; a principal circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of felicitie: for he that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth ſuch an action, vnderſtandeth likewiſe who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: and touching that he addeth, howe the Moraliſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth of iniurie; for repelling whereof combat is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. I ſay, the conſequence is nothing worth: for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt diſcourſeth of iniuries for inſtruction, how to knowe the iuſt from the vniuſt, and not that ſuch iniuries, are by combat to be repelled, ſeeing iniuſtice and iniurie is to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16643:77"/>be returned with iuſtice, as the lawes commaund, and not by vniuſt meanes, as is combate. But before you numbred the ſupportation of iniurie amongſt vices, ſaid Count <hi>Guydo,</hi> and not reuenging the ſame with proper valor. The Perepate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) doth not ſpoile a man of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, like the Stoicke, for man being partaker of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue facultie, can not be inſenſible: but woulde, that with reaſon moderating them, he might reduce them to the ſtate of mediocritie: it is therefore neceſſary, that a man in the ſame inſtant hee is offended, ſhould be angry, and therefore at the ſame time it ſhall bee lawfull for him to make that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge he can, and which honeſtie permitteth: which not doing, he runneth into the vice of ſtupiditie, or puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (if wee may vſe ſuch wordes:) And if hee coulde not, replied <hi>Turchi</hi> at the ſame inſtant returne due reuenge, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through inequality of party, or ſome other impediment, to repell the iniury, and not ſeeme ſottiſh, ſhall it not bee lawfull for him, to haue recourſe to combate, and to attempt the recouery of honor, by his proper valor. It is not requiſite for him, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> to haue recourſe to combate: for as I told you, he muſt not repell iniurie, with a meane vniuſt, but iuſt, according as the lawes commaund: Wherefore oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion once paſt, it is not conuenient, that in cold bloud, as we vſually ſay, he performe any other matter with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per valor: for in ſuch a caſe, the condition of the iniurier is far worſe, than of him iniuried. How may it be ſaid count <hi>Guido,</hi> that the offerer of iniurie, ſhould be of worſe conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, than he that receiueth it: I of my ſelfe following com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, ſhould haue beleeuéd the contrary: conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iniurier vſurpeth the honor of him iniuried, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily vrgeth him to recouery of the ſame. The conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the iniuried is leſſe wicked, ſaid <hi>Gual:</hi> becauſe, to receiue iniury, ſheweth no more but impotencie, &amp; is without vice: but to offer it, is a thing vitious, and blame-worthy, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he faileth in iuſtice, and therefore looſeth his honor. In like maner, the receiuer of iniury looſeth his honor, ſaid <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cagnino</hi>)
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16643:77"/>by failing in valor, and ſhe wing himſelfe worthy of contempt. To receiue iniurie, is not to faile in valor (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) but ſo to receiue it, as thereof to make no iuſt reuenge. And what vnderſtand you by iuſt reuenge, replied <hi>Calcagnino?</hi> And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> the reuenge ſhalbe iuſt, when at the ſame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inſtant hee is offended, hee ſhall attempt to repell the iniurie with his proper valor: and it is iuſt, for he doth that, which by naturall and ciuill law, is permitted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which make it lawfull, to repell force, with force: and when through inequalitie of partie, or other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he cannot performe this, hee is bound after the fact, to haue recourſe to the magiſtrate, and by them to ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, rather then by combate, to the end that Magiſtrates, and lawes, ſee me not in Citties to be created in vaine. Hee that in ſuch a caſe ſhuld runne to the Magiſtrate (ſaid count <hi>Hercules</hi>) would giue notice of ſmall valor, and ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe worthy of contempt, and conſequently, to be but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly honored. No man remaineth diſhonored (ſaide <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenguo</hi>) but hee which offendeth againſt iuſtice, or fortitude, as wee haue ſaid: therefore he which in receiuing iniurie, hath committed no vile fact, looſeth not his honor, although afterwarde, he ſeek reuenge at the hande of the Magiſtrate: neither for this, doth he faile in valor, but he ſhould faile in iuſtice, if contemning the lawes, and Magiſtrates, hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed reuenge of himſelfe, and ſhould attempt againſt the lawes. I beſeech you tell mee vnfainedly, hee that goeth about to recouer his goods, and ſeeketh reuenge of the theefe, faileth hee in valor, hauing recourſe to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates? I know you will ſay hee doth not, becauſe the laws ſo commaunde: and wherefore then would you haue him to faile, which aſſayeth to recouer his honour, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth reuenge from the Magiſtrate, ſeeing the laws ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, and that they puniſh them ſeuerely, who attempt by any other meanes, as contemners of the Magiſtrates, and laws, which chaſtice with no leſſe penalty impeachers of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans honor, then the offence that theeues commit.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16643:78"/>Me thinkes ſir Knight, ſaid the count of <hi>Scandiano,</hi> you are contrarie to your ſelfe; for yeſterday you ſaide, that a man of honor, ought by al meanes to repell iniurie, not to ſeeme worthy of contempt. &amp; that he ought not only to enter into combat, but further was bound to maintain au vniuſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, for the concealing of his defect, ſeeing honor is not loſt before offences be reuealed: and now you would haue him ſeek recouerie of his honor, &amp; reuenge not by his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per valor, but from the hands of the magiſtrate: and there is no doubt, but relying on the worlds iudgement, hee that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to recouer honor, by this means ſhould bee noted for vile &amp; cowardlike. There is no contradicto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in my words (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) if in ſiniſter ſence they be not interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I then ſaid, and now affirme, that a man of honor ought by all meanes to endeuor to maintaine poſſeſsion thereof: but aboue all, by iuſt means, as theſe be I haue here ſet down vnto you: and if they were not ſufficient, through ſome euill cuſtome, and that he were in danger to loſe his honour, hee ought not refuſe then to fight, notwithſtanding the quarrel were vniuſt, &amp; enter into the liſts, if co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat were in vſe: &amp; this is one of the principalleſt imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that this honor hath, by me rightly termed, imperfect; wherfore whoſoeuer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maketh profeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ought by right &amp; wrong to procure the preſeruation of it; as was yeſterday ſufficiently ſhewed: only Iwil ſay, that the moral philſopher determineth not of this honor, he being of himſelfe, and alone, as a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, hardly capable of humane felicitie, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently leſſe ought to cenſure, or entreate of vniuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, ſeeing vppon this, honour is altogeather gorunded, and hath his foundation.</p>
            <p>You (replied the Counte <hi>Scandiano</hi>) euer terme Combate vniuſt, yet haue you made no demonſtration of the iniuſtice thereof; and notwithſtanding, this I haue ſeene, ſome places cited out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by thoſe that are learned, out of which they gather, that combate is iuſt, and ought to bee permitted: eſpecially in the firſt of his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoricke,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16643:78"/>where hee admitteth reuenge, which not beeing granted, ſaith hee, diuers inconueniences woulde enſue: and in the fift of his Moralles hee ſaith, that Cittizens muſt endeuour to repell offence, in that to ſuffer iniurie is a kinde of ſeruitude: And <hi>Homer</hi> whoſe poeme by opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the diuine Philoſopher, is the ſeeing glaſſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, and author of combate, maketh <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> to fight hand to hand at defiance, as alſo <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Aiax,</hi> the which by <hi>Virgil</hi> &amp; <hi>Arioſto</hi> hath bin obſerued: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanteth there of the graueſt authors, who writing, labour to make it iuſt, and worthy to bee admitted, as a thing profitable to preſeruation, and recouerie of honor, and to liue well in a Cittie amongſt whom is Doctor <hi>Paris de puteo,</hi> and <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> neither are their arguments to bee diſpiſed, and for my part, I eſteeme them preualent.</p>
            <p>If by others, and eſpecially by moſt learned <hi>Suſiue,</hi> ſaide <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> it were not prooued againſt Doctor <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris de puteo</hi> and <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> that Combate is a thing moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, I would labour to make you conceiue the iniuſtice thereof, but this man hauing philoſophically and learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreated thereof in a booke of his owne, intituled of the iniuſtice of Combate, referring you ouer to that, I will ſpeake no further of it. Although excellent <hi>Suſius,</hi> ſaide <hi>Beuelaqua,</hi> hath plentifully ſpoken thereof, as you ſay, yet wil it be acceptable to vnderſtand alſo ſomething from you in this point, ſeeing at this inſlant we haue not <hi>Suſius</hi> booke about vs. That you may not account me, luskiſh &amp; ſſothfull, ſaid <hi>Gua.</hi> beholde I deſire to gine you ſatisfaction. Combate, is repugnant to nature, &amp; contrary to laws diuine, and ciuill: To Nature it repugneth, becauſe ſhee entendeth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſeruation; Combate to kil and deſtroy: it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to lawes diuine, and ciuill, becauſe, neither by the one, or other law it is permitted, that a particular man ſhuld diſpoſe, either of his own, or of another mans life: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the law reſpecteth a particular man, not as of himſelfe, but as belonging to the country &amp; Prince, vnder
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16643:79"/>whoſe dominion he is ſubiect. Secondly it is vniuſt, becauſe it contendeth to prooue the vertue of the minde, with force and dexteritie of body; which meane is by it ſelfe inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for if with force of body the vertue of the mind, were neceſſarily conioyned, a country man or porter, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more baſe, might eaſily be more honorable &amp; vertuous then one noble. Thirdly, in combate the knowledge of truth and equitie, is referred to the arbitrement of fortune, a Iudge moſt vncertaine, and to the ſword, depriued of reaſon: therefore it is vniuſt: neither auaileth it any thing to ſaye, that in combate God fauoureth the iuſt; for if that were true, he ſhould neuer ouercome that had wrong on his ſide, and yet we ſee by experience, that the lier by being more ſtrong and fortunate, hath ouercome him with truth on his ſide: ſo that to ordaine combat, is rather a tempting of God, then by ſuch a meanes to draw from God iuſt iudgement. Finally, it was neuer by any common wealth accepted, or approued of, neither by any auncient State, that for cauſe of honor, or wants of proofe in inveſtigation of truth, they ſhould haue recourſe to combate; nor <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther philoſopher, or Law-giuer, did euer approue or ſo much as know this monſtrous maner of conflict: and although <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> affirme, in the places by you cited, that reuenge ought to be made, &amp; that ſupportation of iniury, is a kinde of ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, yet he meaneth not this ſhould be performed by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt meane, but by a meane iuſt, &amp; as the laws command: for as it is not lawfull to recouer goods from the theeſe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per force, ſo ought it not to be lawful by the ſame meanes to recouer honor: &amp; no leſſe in the one the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other caſe, we ought to haue recourſe to the magiſtrate. Of the ſame opnion was <hi>Plato,</hi> for hee decreed in the eleuenth of his lawes, that the iniuried by wordes, ſhoulde not offend the iniurier, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with modeſtie excuſe himſelfe, of the vice obiected vnto him: &amp; in <hi>Crito:</hi> that we ſhuld not iniury others, thogh by them we had bin offended, for vpon what occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foeuer wee offend another, it is always euill done. In <hi>Gorgia</hi> hee
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16643:79"/>ſheweth howe wee ſhoulde ſerue our turnes with rhetoricall Arte, to accuſe malefactors, that they might bee chaſtiſed. Out of which poſitions, this concluſion may be drawne, that the iniuried is not by himſelfe to worke reuenge, ſeeing that would euer be but euill done, but to accuſe the iniurier to the magiſtrate, who ſtands to preſerue vniuerſall good: What wil you anſwer, replied count <hi>Scand.</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> de <hi>Puteo,</hi> who proueth the iuſtice of combate, from the vniuerſall iuſtice of warre, by God permitted, as wee reade in ſo many places of the ſcripture by him cited: as alſo the reaſons of <hi>Poſſeuino,</hi> who affirmeth, that Combate is lawfull, ſeeing by that meanes a man may recouer the moſt pretious of al other goods, which is honor. <hi>Paris</hi> de <hi>Puteo,</hi> anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> was a good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, in his profeſsion, of the Lawe, although he were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harſh in expreſsing his conceits, and was the firſt that aduaunced this argument of Combate, giuing precepts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: not withſtanding, enclining to euill cuſtome, hee laboured to ſhew, that combate had in it ſome poynt of iuſtice: but he reaſoning from vniuerſall warre, to this particular battaile, which wee call Combate, cannot formally conclude: ſeeing this, not only is not comprehended vnder that general kind, but is further from it, altogether diuerſe: And therefore we muſt obſerue, that generall warre is lawfull, for no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but becauſe men are not placed vnder the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one Prince alone, neyther are all ſtates gouerned by the ſelfe ſame lawes; for if it were otherwiſe, it ſhoulde not be lawfull for one people, to warre againſt another: neither for augmentation of ſtate or any other occaſion, conſidering that by the higheſt Prince, Law, and Iuſtice, euery differêce would be determined, and if any people or citrie ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to right themſelues by armes, as contemners of the Laws, and rebels to the Prince, they ſhould be incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed; but for that the dominion of the earth is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into diuerſe principallities, they hauing no ſuperiours, make <hi>Mars</hi> Iudge of their controuerſies, and put ouer their right to Armes: Warre is therefore lawfull, for want of a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16643:80"/>publike reuenger of iniuries, &amp; therfore God commaunded his choſen people, that they ſhould take vp armes, for their defence, &amp; ſlay their enemies, minding they ſhould be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of diuine iuſtice. But this battell performed betweene two particular men, ſhall neuer be lawfull, which we do call Combate. Seeing particular men, haue a Prince, lawe, and magiſtrates, whome it concerneth to reuenge iniuries, and determine controuerſies, which may fall out betwixt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men. And if <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> had ſaide, that Combate is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and vniuſt meane to recouer honor, he had well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: For combate offendeth the magiſtrate, and contemnes the lawes: they entring into combate carrying this mind, to reuenge iniurie with their proper hand, &amp; by a wicked and inſufficient meane to attempt, the finding out, and proofe of truth, not conſidering that the lawes and magiſtrates, take order for men iniurious and liars. And yet combate as a thing lawfull, ſaid Count <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> hath beene granted euen by the hie prieſt himſelfe, as we reade of Pope <hi>Martine,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that two brothers, who had broght into the field two armies face to face, ſhould betweene them two performe the combate, committing vnto the hand, ſworde, and moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine lotte, the title of that principallitie, whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them ſelues they contended. And further, they which make Combate lawfull, are of opinion, that it may be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when by other meane we can not attaine to knowledge of truth, as if combate were lawful in the ſame nature, as are thoſe kindes of torments, wherewith the Criminaliſts ſerue their turne, to make malefactors confeſſe.</p>
            <p>Combat was iuſtly permitted by Pope <hi>Martine,</hi> between thoſe brethren, ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> as alſo that in <hi>Spaine.</hi> between two cooſins allowed by <hi>Scipio,</hi> who contended about princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallities: and no leſſe iuſt were the conflicts of the <hi>Horatij</hi> &amp; <hi>Curiatij,</hi> and it may euer be lawfull to put twoo mens liues in danger, for preſeruation of a thouſand others: But it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a thing honeſt nor iuſt, to ſearch out truth, by way of combate; for it is a moſt fallacious proof, in that the liar, may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16643:80"/>vanquiſh as well as the other with trueth on his ſide. What is to be done then, ſaid Count <hi>Guido,</hi> when wee cannot attayne to knowledge of trueth? That which the lawes command, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> which is, the Defendant to be free, when the Plaintife cannot prooue, either by witneſſe, writings, or ſome other faithfull teſtimoniall; and theſe failing, other proofe is no way requifite, or vpon this to vndertake Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Put we the caſe, replied <hi>Calcagnino,</hi> that one call an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther traitor, or obiect vnto him, that he hath committed ſom one of thoſe malefacts, that depriue of honor, and the other denieth it with a lie, what ought the iniurier in this caſe to do? He is bound, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> to auerre his ſaying, as before you haue vnderſtood, and not ſo doing, he remaineth infamous, as a liar, vniuſt, and an impeacher of another mans honor: and the Defendant ſtandeth ſtil in his firſt degree of honor: neither neede he vpon this to enter the liſtes: and if he anſwered (added <hi>Calcagnino</hi>) to the lie, with a box on the care, or any other blow, would not this be ſufficient proofe of his ſaying: He ſhould not onely (ſaid <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) not proue it, but auouching it by no other teſtimoniall, ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine tainted with double infamie: For beſides being a falſe ſlaunderer, he ſhoulde be an iniurier by deedes, and before I ſhewed you, that they which iniurie others, faile in iuſtice, and are infamous. They notwithſtanding that intreate of Combate, ſaide Count <hi>Hercules,</hi> haue ſet it downe for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule, that iniury in words is taken away by the iniury of deed, and that a lie is ſatisfied with a box on the eare, or any blow with what thing elſe ſoeuer, they alleaging this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for a maime, vnto which no anſwer can be made, that one iniury, by another greater than that is clean taken away, and that the iniurie of deedes is greater then that of wordes: and this in ſuch a ſort is obſerued for cuſtome, that it is impoſsible, or at the leaſt very difficult, to introduce any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawe, amiddeſt theſe termes of honor. It is no maruell, anſwered <hi>Gualingno,</hi> if thoſe that intreate of combate, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeake with any foundation of reaſon: for neceſſarily
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16643:81"/>from a matter vniuſt, many poynts vniuſt, and vnreaſonable muſt needes proceede: wherefore theſe men deſirous to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage points of honour with combate, and euil cuſtome, haue ſupplanted the lawes of honor, and multiplied abuſes. I ſay therefore, that this ſuppoſition, that the iniurie of deedes is greater than that of wordes, is not onely, not alwayes true, but further for the moſt part falſe, ſeeing one may bee more diffamed by burdenſome and opprobrious wordes, than by the iniury of deedes. As for example: he ſhal remaine more diſhonored that ſwalloweth vp the terme of Traitour, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, or any ſuch like brutiſh ſpeach, without making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, then ſhall another that takes the Baſtanado, a box on the eare, a blow, or any ſuch like iniurie of deede: for not to attempt reuenge of a blowe or baſtanado, notes ſmal valour, and impotencie, but yet is without vice: but cloſely to digeſt the name of a traitor or murderer, carrieth with it, not onely note of vility, but ſuppoſeth the vice in him iniuried, obiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto him by the iniurier, and therefore ſuch an one ſhalbe much more infamous. It may be prooued alſo by this other reaſon, that contumelious wordes are apter to impeach an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans honor, then deedes. For as they affirme, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of combate, there is not ſo grieuous an iniurie indeed, which with words may not be lenified: which could not be, if wordes were not much more effectuall, as wel in ablation, as reſtitution of honor. It ſhould ſeeme to be a common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, ſaid Count <hi>Scandiano,</hi> that the iniurie of deedes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remooued by wordes: as alſo it carrieth ſome reaſon: for can wordes take away a baſtanado or blowe, and howe ſhuld they effect, that the ſcarres remain nor in the receuers viſage, to his perpetual diſhonor? Wherefore there be ſome, who in making peace perſwade the iniuriers by deede, that they make no account to vtter ſome ſubmiſsiue or daſtard like ſpeach, for concluſion of peace, and ſatisfying of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried: they alleadging, that feathers and wordes, are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with the winde, but deedes continue euerlaſtingly. Such like men little vnderſtand the lawe of honor, anſwered
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16643:81"/>like men little vnderſtand the law of honor (anſwered <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenguo</hi>) ſeeing there is not ſo greiuous an iniurie of deed, which by words may not be mittigated, the which wordes, though they cannot take away ſcarres in the body or face, yet are they of force to wipe out the ſpot of infamie, and to retúrne it vpon the iniurier, as for example: if the iniurying in deedes, ſhall alleadge vnto the imuried: I confeſſe I haue committed an vniuſt act, in ſtrikeing you, ſeeing you are not a perſon worthy of contempt, and I humbly require pardon of you, with other ſuch like wordes: who ſeeth not that the iniuried (in reſpect of honor) by ſuch wordes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in farre better condition then the iniurier.</p>
            <p>And what thinke you of that other concluſion (ſaide <hi>Turcho</hi>) that one iniurie is taken away by another greater then that? This other concluſion (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) hath beene an occaſion to multiplie inſolencies in men, making them prooue rather infamous then honorable. Wherefore I ſay vnto you, that iniurie in wordes, is properly by words remooued, and improperly by deeds: and in like manner, he which iniurieth by wordes, properly taketh it away by wordes and witneſſe, and improperly by deedes: as if one ſhould call me traitor, with the lie I properly take away the iniurie, but if without the lie, I ſtrike or wound him, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly returne the iniurie: for by this meanes I deny not that I am a traytor, neither vrge him to prooue his ſaying, although after a certaine manner, I manifeſt him a man worthy of contempt: and therefore he may leaue the firſt, and betake himſelfe to the ſecond quarrell as iuſt, by ſaying: I will proue vpon thee that I am not a man of contempt, &amp; that thou haſt vniuſtly done to ſtrike mee, in which quarrel ouercoming, the other ſhall be alſo conuinced of treaſon: in like manner he improperly, and fooliſhly retourneth the lie, with a box on the eare, the which, or any other blow, though in a certaine ſorte, it noteth him ſtrucken, worthy of contempt, yet doth it not proue or verifie the ſaying of him, who hath iniuried by wordes: in that a box on the eare, or a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16643:82"/>blowe, is not ſufficient proofe to ſhew that one is a traitour: but rather it plainely teſtifieth, that the committer of ſuche an act, is a moſt vniuſt man, a great iniurier, and wounder of another mans honour: ſo that they which ſette downe theſe concluſions, haue ſpoken, not altogether ſincerely, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather, as I haue ſaide, wicked cuſtome, than direct rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and haue beene, as alſo now are, the occaſions of great inconueniences: for if it were not in vſe, to retourne the lie with a blowe, there would be but few iniuriers by wordes, it being hard to find words enow, to auerre wordes iniurious, and not proouing them, he ſhould continue infamous.</p>
            <p>You ſir Knight, ſaid <hi>Beuelacqua,</hi> haue with ſufficient ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie declared, that Combate is an Vniuſt thing, contrary to humane felicitie: as alſo, that it is not grounded vppon true, but imperfect honor: and that the Philſopher in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike cuſtomes, cannot intreate thereof, but as of a vice, to the end, that by the vertuous man, it may be abhorred. It reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that you here declare, whom the treatie heere of did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, if it were in vſe: and this wil ſerue greatly to purpoſe, ſeeing in doubtfull caſes of honor, we ſhall know whither to haue recourſe for counſell. Without doubt (anſwered <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linguo,</hi>) and (bee it ſpoken with leaue of your countrieman <hi>Pigna</hi> and <hi>Poſſeuino</hi>) the argument of Combate is proper to the Ciuilian, and not to the morall Philoſopher, as hee is a Moraliſt: and this I wil manifeſt vnto you, by infallible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: And firſt, the Cruilian intendes that honor, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euery one maketh profeſſion, vppon which Combate is grounded: For the lawes puniſh detractors from other mens honors: and in like manner, declare who are infamous, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticing many offences with the puniſhment of infamie: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, combate is either by law (as it appeareth by the law of Lombardy) or elſe by cuſtom: the Ciuilian is he which intendeth laws and cuſtoms, and ruleth and ordaineth them: Thirdly, the termes which in combate are vſed and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are proper to the Ciuilian, and by him are defined, and conſidered, as aſſailant, defendant, quarrel, billes of chalenge,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16643:82"/>to prouoke, maintaine, and ſuch like, therefore combate is proper to the Ciuilian: Fourthly, the bill and quarrel which by meane of Combare direct to the tribunall of armes, hath the ſelfe ſame proportion, and like rules, as hath the Booke and action, which direct to the ſeate of Iuſtice: the Ciuilian therefore beeing he that cenſureth the Booke and action in place of iudgement, it is as conuenient that he ſcame the bil, and order the quarrel by combate, in it expreſſed: Fiftly, the Ciuilian determineth all maner of iniuries, as well by deede as word, hauing reſpect to the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the perſons, place, and time; for repelling of which iniuries, Combate is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, therefore Combate is a ſubiect appropriate vnto the Ciuilian: Sixtly, the Ciuilian is he that pronounceth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideth, whether the quarrell deſerueth to be put to triall of armes; for when we may vnderſtand by other meane, who is honorable, and who diſhonorable, it is not lawfull to come to combate: Laſt of all, the Ciuilians be they, that intreate and ordaine, touching all ſortes of torments vſed for inueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of trueth; combate therefore being (as the ſame wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof affirme) a kind of torment to find out the truth, when by other mean it cannot be knowne, it wil follow, that to intreate &amp; order wel combate, belongeth to the Ciuilian.</p>
            <p>Though ſo many and firme reaſons were not ſufficient to perſwade, yet common vſe &amp; experience might ſerue the turne; ſeeing ordinarily in occaſions of combate, the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were wont to be aduiſed by Doctors of the lawe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the ſundry opinions of moſt excellent Ciuilians, which are yet in Print; beſides thoſe good Authours that haue intreated of combate, were Ciuilians, as doctor <hi>Paris</hi> de <hi>Puteo,</hi> and <hi>Mutius,</hi> who alwayes vſed iuridicall termes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, &amp; ſuppoſitions, agreeable to the proper argument and matter by them handled; ſo that <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> and <hi>Pigna</hi> nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not haue ſaide, that the Lawyers vſurped to themſelues this matter of Combate, belonging properly to Polliticke cuſtomes; for, beſides that wee haue conuinced them, they themſelues intreating of it morally, haue runne into inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16643:83"/>errors, and infallibly prooued, that the argument of combate, concerneth not the Moraliſt, but the Ciuillian. Me thinkes ſaide Count <hi>Scandiano,</hi> that this treatiſe more befitteth a Souldier then a Roabed man, ſeeing vnto him bookes bee proper, and the management of armes to the Souldier; firſt becauſe combate is borne between the ſound of trumpet and drum: ſecondly in that the ſouldier deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of generall warre, and diſcipline militarie, he may the better likewiſe, dilate of warre ſingle, and particular, for ſo is combate: conſidering that vnder the vniuerſall the particular is comprehended. Souldiers according to their principles can not diſcourſe of combate, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> becauſe the precepts, wherewith warre generall is ruſed, are wholly contrarie to combate. Art militarie, in generall war, ordaineth all aduantage, approoueth all oddes and inequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as well in the number of men, as of armes, and places vantagious for battaile: and commendeth him that can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, by all manner of ſtratageme, policie, and deceit; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in ſingle fight, we deteſt all aduantage and ſubtiltie, and ſeeke equalitie, to the ende, victorie may only depend on proper valor; but further, combate not only doth not adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but iniurieth alſo profesſion militarie, and therefore by it ought not only, not to be directed, but further wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: for combat cauſeth ſeditions, maketh ſouldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and diſobedient to the magiſtrates of the field, which by the ſame militarie art, were ordained for to determine all differences and brawles, which fall out among ſouldiers: to the end, that peace maintained betwixt friendes, they might with greater valor make warre Vpon the enemie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Romanes did not onely puniſh thoſe, which durſt fight ſingly amongſt themſelues, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, who without conſent of the magiſtrate performed combat with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, as we reade of <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> who cauſed his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious forme to be ſtrucken with a cimeter, hauing performed combat with an enemie, without licence from the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. But leauing examples, &amp; comming to common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16643:83"/>and vſe, lette vs ſee whether the probleames and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, which by combate are determined, haue any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude with the other of profeſsion military, and generall warre.</p>
            <p>In combate it is determined betwixt the aſſailant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, of iniuries and oppreſsion, as wel in words, as deeds: of the lie, of the forme of bills, of the maner of ſending theſe bils, of challenge, of laying out the field, according to forme of patent: and further, many other queſtions are diſcuſſed, as, whether the quarel deſerue to be referred to proof of armes, if after the defiance vpon any ſodaine occaſion wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to come to battel, whether a man halfe ſubdued, and by a lie hauing the better of the field, may demaund a new day: who ought to be admitted to combate, and who not, of the election of Armes, whether one may fight by his champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the difference of nobilitie, as well in priuate men, as in great ſtates and princes, with other ſuch like poynts. In generall warre, it is principally diſcuſſed, how to ſet an army in order to fight, the maner of arming it for obtaining of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, in what order they are to mooue forward, and march with the army, and how, and in what ſituation they are to take vp their lodging, and after what manner to fortifie and entrench, to prepare and conuoy victuall, to raiſe fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the manner how to defend and aſſaile, of ſtratagems, or as we may ſay, of militarie deceits, with other like poynts, the which are altogether diuerſe from thoſe which in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate are decided; and therefore we muſt conclude, that ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as beeing ſouldiers, may well manage armes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme combate, but not diſpoſe of it, according to principles of military profeſsion. Fortitude being the principall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſouldiers, ſaid <hi>Beuelacqua,</hi> &amp; in combate aſwel the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the body as minde beeing exerciſed, I woulde alſo haue thought, that it had properly appertained to ſouldiers to define of combate, eſpecially, hauing ſeene in Print, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe opinions touching the ſame, of famous and woorthy Captaines, who are reputed amongſt the chiefeſt and beſt:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16643:84"/>and further, I ſaw in <hi>France</hi> while I was reſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the court, that vpon queſtion and difference of honour, Gentlemen rather repaired to ſouldiours then Doctors, accepting of their opinions, as they had beene oracles. That fortitude practiſed in Combate (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) is not the ſame which is the propper vertue of Arte Militarie: beecauſe that with vertue, and this being farre remote from iuſtice, is accompanied with vice: and therefore wee may truely ſay, that in combate wee rather practiſe force and dexterity of bodie, then that fortitude, which is a vertue of the minde. Touching your hauing ſeene Captaines write, diſcourſe, and intreate of poyntes of honour and combate, yeelding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their iudgements, this concludeth not that it is a proper office belonging to that Art; for they do this by a certaine practiſe and naturall iudgement, or peraduenture, as men not only in warre, but alſo in other diſciplines experienced. By thoſe reaſons therefore wee haue alleadged, and others which to them wee mind to adde, the error of <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> ſhall be cleare vnto you, who vainely excludeth Lawyers from the ſubiect of combate: and you ſhall obſerue, that by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers or Ciuilians, I vnderſtand not law giuers: for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt wiſe, and creating lawes, as inſpired by a diuine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, cannot make any one law, which ſhall not bee moſt iuſt and godlie: and therefore theſe ought, not only, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe of Combate, but euen wholly to exclude it, as Vniuſt: But by Lawyers, I meane, thoſe that interpret, counſell, and iudge according to the lawes, vnto whom the treatie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of out of doubt apperrameth, as alſo to diſpoſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, if it were in vſe: and likewiſe to counſell in poyntes belonging to that honour, whereupon Combate is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>And this ſhal be the better known vnto vs, if we do but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the termes, queſtions, &amp; rules, which about Combat are freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted: For we ſhal find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either the ſelf ſame, or altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like them, which the lawyers haue euery day in hand. And as for the perſons that enter into combate, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16643:84"/>that the termes of aſſailant &amp; defendant (as we haue ſaid) be not properly belonging to Lawiers? and that the Lawier doth not declare, who is the aſſailant, and who the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as alſo what is the office of the aſſailant, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the defendant. And comming to the billes; who will deny, that they carying, with them the ſimilitude of thoſe bookes that aduocates carry in their handes, belong not to Lawiers to be preſcribed and framed, they differing in no other reſpect, but that in the bil, honor is demaunded, and in the booke, goods, and many times alſo honour: and that the bill citeth the defendant, to the tribunall of armes, and the booke to the tribunall of the lawes and magiſtrate? then paſsing ouer to laying out of the fielde, what is this lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the fielde, but the electing of ſome ſpatious place, where the ſtrife is to bee determined, about which if any queſtion ariſe, who is to decide it but the Lawier? who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is alwais he, that giueth ſentence, whether the Iudge be competent or no. In Combate iniuries are debated, which be opprobrious, and which not: And who can better diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of this then the Lawier, who hath iuſtice for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per obiect, and whoſe propertie it is to conſider all kindes of iuſtice, and iniuſtice, and conſequently of iniuries, which bee the principall, part of iniuſtice? Neither <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> nor <hi>Pigna</hi> would deny me, if they were liuing, that it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the magiſtrate, to diſtribute puniſhment towards thoſe that are iniurious: and if this bee true, how could hee make iuſt diſtribution if he knewe not, and did not diſtinguiſh all kindes of iniury. In combate the lie is diſcuſſed, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion mooued, which is a preualent lie, and which none: &amp; this appertaineth to the lawier; for the magiſtrate puniſheth lying, and eſpecially that which to another mans loſſe and reproach, is tolde, and therefore it is neceſſary hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand which is preualent, and which not, for the preualent lie is giuen as ſtirred vp by an iniury, and therefore is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from puniſhment, if hee to whom it is giuen, proue not his obiection true: and the inſufficent lye is that which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16643:85"/>is not giuen vpon receit of an iniury, and becauſe in this caſe it ſauoureth of iniurie, as accuſing his aduerſarie of ſlander, it ought therefore to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>In combat the firſt of any other thing, it is debated, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the quarrell deſerue to be put to trial of armes; and this is proper to the Ciuilian: firſt, becauſe the determination of ſuch queſtions is contained in the Lombard law: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that the Lawyer is he that iudgeth, whether the ciuil triall of the cauſe made, were ſufficient or no: for if it were ſufficient proofe of armes ceaſeth: in combate, the diſparitie and inequality of the combatants is called into queſtion, and who may be admitted, who refuſed: and this is alſo a diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion belonging to the Lawyer: For he being conuerſant, not onely about iuſtice commutatiue, but alſo concerning that diſtributiue, being no other but to diſtribute puniſhment, and rewardes, with geometricall proportion, of neceſsitie he muſt needs know thoſe offences that make an other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of chaſticement and infamy: as likewiſe the actions, that are meritorious of reward and honor; and conſequently, that he determine who ought to be refuſed as infamous, and who as honourable to be admitted to the triall of armes: in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate alſo is debated the diſtinctions of Nobilitie, as well of priuate men as of Princes: and this alſo belongeth to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilian, who reſpecteth the degrees and qualities of perſons, to diſtribute iuſtly and with proportion, reward, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment. Thoſe rules alſo, which in combate are obſerued, are proper to the Ciuilians, being the ſelfe-ſame that are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ciuil iudgements. In combate this is obſerued: that after the chalenge is accepted, it is not lawful for the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to offend one another, but in the determined day of battell: this precept is like to that which ſaith, during the ſute let there be no innouation of any thing, and whoſoeuer diſturbeth the poſſeſſor, the ſute ſtil hanging, is intended to be fallen from all his right and title: in combate is this other poynt: that he which appeareth not in the field on the day prefixed for battel, is intended to haue loſt his whole inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16643:85"/>and this alſo is decided by the Ciuilians, who ſay that al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lawes exclame againſt the man ſtubburne and contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p>This other rule is alſo auerred, that the day and time of battaile expired, and the aſſailant not proouing, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant is intended to be victor, this being likewiſe a maxime with the Ciuilians, the lawe affirming, that the aſſailant not prouing, in the prefixed and inſtant time, the defendant is abſolued. To conclude, there is not any thing in combate, which doth not reſemble thoſe poynts handled in the lawes. Proceede no further, ſaide Count <hi>Alfonſo Turchi,</hi> becauſe now wee are ſufficiently ſatisfied, that in doubtes, I will not ſay, appertaining to Combate (ſeeing God bee thanked) it is no more in vſe, but pertaining to the honour, whereof euery one maketh profesſion, wee muſt haue recourſe to the Ciuilian, and not to the Moraliſt, the honour whereof hee entreateth, beeing from this very diuerſe. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the vſe of combate bee taken away, ſayde Count <hi>Guido</hi>) yet are neyther brawles, nor tumultes remooued, which euery day bee ſtirred vppe, with great effuſion of bloud: the which, in that by combate they can not bee defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there is an other inuention diabolicall enough found out, which is not Combate, and that is the field, whither Gentlemen of honor oftentimes runne to decide their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with armes: And this manner of fighting is now in ſuch vſe, as I am doubtfull, whether a man of honor offered the field, may refuſe without preſumption of cowardiſe. As in Ciuil iudgements (ſayde <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) the defendant is not bound to anſwere the plaintife, except there be compotent court and Iudge aſsigned him, ſo that defendant, who to the Tribunall of Armes is cited, neede not there appeare, without a ſecure field and Iudge: and refuſing, hee ought not onely, not to be held as a Coward, but further, a man of honour: For it is proper to the eues, murtherers, and ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to fight in wooddes and ſolitary places, and for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of honour, to performe battaile, in the preſence
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16643:86"/>of Princes, and many knights, to whoſe iudgement the Combatants referre themſelues. And from thoſe Lordes in the field, they receiue (as from competent Iudges, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their victorie, and in what maner they haue ſubdued. Neceſsity maketh many things lawfull which are vnlawfull, (added <hi>Calcagnini</hi>) and there is no doubt, but if combate were in vſe, the field might lawfully be refuſed: but not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by other meanes then this to ende quarrels, it ſeemeth the iniuried, which is Aſſailant, hath in a certaine ſort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his honor, when hee hath vrged the fielde of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, &amp; the defendant not accepting of it, he incurreth ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition of timidity and ſlender valour: and touching the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of a ſecure iudge and field: what better iudge, or truer teſtimoniall of victory can there be, then the ſword? For to returne from Battaile with the ſword bloudy, and vnwounded, noteth that Combatant victorious: and on the contrary, to remaine dead, or greeuouſly wounded, is a ſigne of vanquiſhment: Moreouer, combatants go not into the fielde alone by themſelues, but for ſecuritie, each one carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with him a confident friend, of vnſpotted fidelity, or ſome Gentleman of honour, who after performance, giueth teſtimony of the valour and victory of the Combatants.</p>
            <p>The ſword (replied <hi>Gualingno</hi>) cannot be a ſincere teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor a iuſt iudge, for we ſee, that he mortally wounded, hath firſt before his death taken priſoner his enemie, and the Confidents, by being each of them partial to their Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are not faithfull teſtimonies of valour and victorie: and we ſee by experience, that ſeldome times they carry in mind the circumſlances of the conflict, in recounting the fact: vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon which afterwards queſtions haue riſen, and freſh quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, both betwixt them, as alſo betweene the Champions: So that in any wiſe the field is to be auoyded, being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all law, and ancient cuſtome of Knighthood, apt rather to frame new, then to take vp old quarrels. What muſt we then do, ſayd <hi>Beuelacqua</hi>) is it neceſſary we continue alwaies in Bralles, finding no meane to determine them? Not ſo
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16643:86"/>(anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) but they muſt be decided, as diuine and humane lawes commaund, that is, peaceably, and ſo, as honour by them may be reſtored, who haue vſurped it. As this is a moſt ſingular and religious mean, ſo comprehendeth it verie great difficulty, ſaide <hi>Scandiano;</hi> for in peace nothing elſe being ſought after, then to reduce the parties to equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or that ſuch a peace ſhould be effected, as that the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and the iniurying, might remaine equally poſſeſſed of honour: bee it not therefore troubleſome vnto you Sir knight, diſcourſing yet ſomewhat further, to deliuer alſo in this poynt your iudgement and opinion.</p>

For the iniurier ſhal euer be taxed, hauing by iniurie failed in iuſtice, &amp; he iniuried not hauing extremitie, offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any vertue, eſpecially when in receiuing it, hee hath performed his part, ſhall not haue loſt his honour, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iniurier making peace, cannot abſolutely recouer his honor iuſtly loſt, nor be equall to him iniuried. This is a plaine paradox (replied <hi>Calcagnino</hi>) altogither contrarie to a common opinion, for in concluding peace, it is helde for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the vantage remaineth on the offenders ſide, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he hath performed ſome notable iniurie, as that of deede: this being confirmed by the authority of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, in the firſt of his Ethikes, where he ſayth, that the iniurier hath in him more good then hee iniuried. This
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16643:87"/>(ſaid <hi>Gualin.</hi>) is the fooliſh vulgar opinion, which holdeth for couragious, valiant, and honorable, the proude, inſolent, and thoſe readie to iniurie others; and conceiue not, that the greater the iniurie is they offer, be it by word or deede, the more vniuſt and wicked the iniurier is: and that this is true, the lawes ſeuerely puniſh ſuch like iniuriers, not chaſticing them iniuried, as thoſe without vice, and who wil denie, that they are not alſo infamous, which are by the lawes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate puniſhed? Touching the authoritie of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, you ſhal conſider that good is of three natures, good profitable, pleaſant, and honeſt: when it is ſaid, the iniurier hath in him more good, it is intended by profitable &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and not that honeſt good, which alſo comprehendeth honour: for of this the iniuried hath better ſtore, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no waies failed in iuſtice: wherefore, if the iniurier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in himſelfe, that in force, riches, and friends, hee is more mightie then the iniuried, the other may comfort himſelfe, in that hee is more participant of honour, beeing without vice. I ſee not how it can be, (added <hi>Calcagnino</hi>) that the iniuried ſhould haue more honour, then hee iniury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conſidering the lawes and magiſtrates commaunde and enioyne the iniuriers to reſtore honour to the iniuried. And they that challenge Combate, or come to queſtion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, be no other but thoſe iniuried, who by this meanes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to recouer that honour, which by the iniuried hath been vſurped: &amp; in intreatie of peace, it is euer required, that the iniurier reſtore honour, this being a manifeſt ſigne, that hee hath not onely his own, but that he alſo retaineth that of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans, being of the iniuried: and conſequently that he hath the vantage in honour: what ſay you to this? Before I make you anſwere (ſaide <hi>Gualin</hi>) I will put you in minde of what I ſaide, entreating of honour: for honour is loſt, by failing in iuſtice and valour: vnto which I adde, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of iuſtice is farre more grieuous, and that which is more accompanied with vice, and by the lawes puniſhed, then is the offence of vilitie or cowardize, ſeeing the not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16643:87"/>reuenging of an iniurie, is after a certaine manner without vice, and therefore not puniſhable Further, you ſhall note, that he iniurying, in offering iniurie, not onely looſeth his honor by failing in iuſtice, but moreouer, ſtaineth the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him iniuried, by bringing him in ſuſpition of vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and making him to be eſteemed a man woorthie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: obſerue that I ſay by bringing him in ſuſpition, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if it were manifeſt that the iniuried in the ſame inſtant he receiued it, performed his part and endeuour, hee could not be reputed vile, although through inequaltty or ſo me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduantage, he were wronged: but contrariwiſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurier in ſuch a caſe ſhould remaine noted, with double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that is, both with iniuſtice and cowardize, for to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend with aduantage, diſcouereth vilitie and want of valour: and therefore the iniuried is vrged as well in ciuill iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as before the Tribunall of armes, to prooue that hee iniurying, hath offended him by aduantage &amp; inequalitie, or by ſome bad meane, for iuſtification of his own ſelfe, that he hath not failed in valour, and that the iniurier hath failed both in one and other. Now from this I haue ſpoken, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that the offerer of iniury, remaineth abſolutely infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and the receiuer ſomewhat toucht and blemiſhed: but bicauſe it is in the iniuriers hand, to wipe out the blot of him iniuried, by manifeſting his owne iniuſtice, and the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the other, therefore it is ſaid, he retaineth the honor of the iniuried, and that to him it belongeth, to make reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Magiſtrates and lawes enforce the iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to reſtore honor with his tongue to him iniuried, which is no other, but to confeſſe himſelfe culpable, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried innocent, as alſo in making of peace, the ſelfe ſame is ſought after, which is, that hee iniurying acknowledge, that hee iniuried is not woorthie of contempt, and that hee is a man of valour: in which act queſtionleſſe, the iniurier remaineth with the diſaduantage of honour: and therefore as I haue ſayde, the Magiſtrates compell them who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16643:88"/>other mens honour to make reſtitution thereof, after this manner, to the end that for penaltie of their offence, they may receiue infamie: conſidering that the iniurier can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſtore honor, but he himſelfe muſt reſt ſomewhat at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted. If this truth were as well knowne touching iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men (ſaid <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) as in this point I am fully ſatisfied, they would not be ſo hard, to conclude peace: for men fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues offended, thinke it vnpoſsible, eſpecially being by ſome iniurie of deed, that any means may be found out, whereby in capitulating peace, they ſhould not reſt far inferior in honor to the iniurier. And if the ſelfe ſame (ſaide <hi>Beuelacqua</hi>) were by the iniuriers foreſeene, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee brought to peace: and ſo neceſſarily there would be continuall quarrell, to the ſpecial diſcommodity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> Although in working peace, honor cannot equally bee ballanced, betweene the iniurier, and iniuried, yet for all this the offender muſt not refuſe to reſtore honour to him offended, when this by an honeſt meane may be done, and it ſhall be a meanes honeſt, when he by ſuch an action reſteth not infamous: &amp; not doing this he declareth himſelfe vniuſt, no otherwiſe then he, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly retaineth other mens goods: wherefore thoſe that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite peace, ought by all induſtrie, to finde a meane, throgh which, with all the equalitie poſsible, honor may bee diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted betweene the iniurier, and iniuried: neither can there be a better meane found out for perſwaſion of peace, then when it is made knowne both to the one and other, as alſo in my iudgement, thoſe men are not to bee hearkened vnto, who ſetting downe courſes for proeuring of peace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not, ſo that peace may enſue, though the one reſt with honor, &amp; the other with reproach, by perſwading the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier that he cannot commit a thing more vniuſt or diſhoneſt then to retaine another mans honor, and as in offending he ſhewed him ſelfe ſuperior, ſo he ought not to refuſe, for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of him offended, to manifeſt himſelfe inferior, as alſo that this meane is conuenient for a man penitent and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16643:88"/>ſory for his fact. Yet this courſe is not honeſt for them that eſteeme the honor of the worlde, or that woulde preſerue their good opinion.</p>
               <p>Therefore I am not of their opinion that ſay, there be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences ſo extron me and grieuous, as that no meane can bee found to ſatisfie him offended, exccept he freely remit and forgiue them: For, to come to peace by ſuch an act, is rather the part of a raſh and fooliſh man, than of one honourable. This free remiſsion, is blamed by <hi>Poſſeuino, Mutio,</hi> and <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolo,</hi> ſaid count <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> and therefore I am doubtful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it: There commeth a doubt to my minde, ſaid <hi>Scandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano:</hi>) You ſaid that he iniuried, was touched in honor, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſuſpition that he had failed in valor, or was worthy of contempt; and therefore that he is bound, for disburden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelfe (as by the other vrged) to cauſe debatement in ciuil iudgement, or combate, of the inequalitie, cuil mean and iniuſtice of the iniurier. Put we the caſe, that one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme an iniurie hand to hand, and without inequalitie, or aduantage, in this point, who ſhall remaine with aduantage of honor? You muſt obſerue, ſayde <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> that there are and may bee two ſortes of iniuriers, in themſelues very different: which diuerſitie is gathered from diuerſe endes; for one is principally intentiue to pleaſant good, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to good, honeſt. He intentiue to pleaſant good, is the firſt in offending by wordes, deedes, through malignitie and enuy, or to ſhew himſelfe the more mightie and gallant: And this man offending whomſoeuer, reſleth in worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of honour, then he iniuried: notwithſtanding it is certaine if they offend with inequalitie or aduantage, and by cuill meane, he remaineth double infamous: becauſe he commeth to faile, not onely in iuſtice, but alſo in valour. He intentiue, one good honeſt, is not firſt offending: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prouoked, maketh reuenge with his owne valour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the firſt iniurier, the burden and wrong. Now and if ſo be hee doe reuenge wythout aduauntage, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is much better than that of the iniuried: For hee
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16643:89"/>ſheweth himſelfe, truly valiant, and vnworthy of contempt, committing no vniuſt act, but in contemning the lawes, and Magiſtrates, at whoſe handes he is rather tyed to ſeeke reuenge, then of himſelfe, to the end Magiſtrats (as wee haue ſaid) in a Cittie be not in vain: but this normitie is ſo by cuſtome admitted, that ſuch an iniurier (although he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge in colde bloud) is eſteemed farre more honorable, then is the other that hath recourſe to the Magiſtrate: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that this repairing to the Magiſtrate, breedeth ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of ſmall valor, &amp; impotencie: and to reuenge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, noteth the contrarie. You will then inferre ſaid <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano,</hi> that he which offendeth without manifeſt occaſion, or not being prouoked, in what manner ſoeuer he iniurieth, by himſelfe alone, or otherwiſe accompanied, reſteth more diſhonorable then he offended: for in him is diſcouered that defect, which principally diſpoyleth of honor, being want of iuſtice: and in the iniuried only want of valor appeareth, which is without vice, but yet ſo, as he that hande to hande offendeth by an honorable meanes, &amp; for reuenge of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt iniurie, remaineth honorable, and his aduerſarie infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, becauſe he ſheweth himſelfe valiant, and vnworthy of contempt, being no more vniuſt then he, who by his proper force wil rather take his goods out of the theefes hand, then acknowledge it from the magiſtrate: And this your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pleaſeth me ſo much the more, in that it ſwarueth not from the common cuſtome of gentlemen, and of thoſe who make profeſsion of honor, who ſhould ſeeme in their honor intereſſed, nay and vnworthy to beare armes, if they ſought reuenge of a receiued iniurie rather from the lawes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, then of themſelues.</p>
               <p>Thus much I will inferre (ſade <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) and further therewith conclude, that in according peace, honor cannot be equally ballanced, betweene the offender and iniuried. Notwithſtanding by the ſollicitor thereof it may ſo be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſed, as that there ſhall be no true difference, or at leaſt wiſe very apparent, that may import ſo much as once more
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16643:89"/>or leſſe, and I ſay apparant, becauſe ſometime it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to deceiue and outſhoote them, that to peace would be reduced, neither for this ſhall one demerite the blame of a deceiuer: For the end of the beſt Cittizen is, the felicitie of his common wealth, therefore it ſhall be permitted him to deceiue ſome particular man, for the taking away of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which diſturbeth the generall quiet of a whole Cittie; as alſo this deceit will be commodious to them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, no leſſe then are thoſe pilles, which the Phyſition ſweetneth, to the end the patient, not diſpleaſing his taſte, may bee reduced to health. Nowe vouchſafe I beſeeche you, ſayde <hi>Scandiano</hi>) ſeeing wyth ſo effectuall reaſons you haue excluded combate, to dilate ſomewhat concerning peace, inſtructing vs, howe wee may or ought to deceiue the ſeditious, for reducing of them to peaceable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As there is not (aunſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) a thinge more impious and preiudiciall than combate, ſo I am of opinion, that in the whole worlde (as the giuer of health well ſheweth) there is not any thing that bringeth with it greater felicitie, than beautifull peace: as likewiſe there is not an action more worthy, or beſeeming a Gentleman, as by <hi>Plutarch</hi> it was thought, than to ſollicite peace: It ſhall not therefore greeue mee vppon this poynt to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſome generall rule: For it would be difficult for mee, and to you very tedious, if I ſhould touch all thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occurrences, wherein, and for which, peace is to be treated of. Suppoſing therefore, which otherwhiles I haue ſhewed, that the firſt offender looſeth his honour through the offence of iniuſtice, as alſo the iniuried tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſuſpition of hauing failed in valour, or to be worthie of contempt, it is neceſſary, that in treatie of peace, both the one and the other of theſe offences bee diminiſhed, and after ſuch a ſorte excuſed, that through them the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders reſt not manifeſtly diſhonoured.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that the offence, eſpecially of the iniurier, is mitigated, or at leaſt excuſed by twoo meanes: one is,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16643:90"/>when in accuſing him, wee blame any one of thoſe paſsions and ſodaine motions of the minde, vnto whoſe force it is hard, or in a manner impoſsible to reſiſt, as are anger, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, loue, iealouſie, feare, and ſuch like forcible affections. The ſecond meane is, when the iniurier chargeth himſelfe with ignorance, not that ignorance, which is proper to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked habite, but with the other particular, which rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth the name of errour, then of offence, being the ſame which is connerfant, about the circumſtances before by vs recited, as if hee ſhall confeſſe to haue offended, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the qualitie of the perſon, or his deſert, and not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſuch an action to haue iniuried, as alſo hee did it not to ouercharge him, or as wrongly informed, and ſuch like: ſuſpition of vilitie in him iniuried ſhall bee diminiſhed or taken away, by ſhewing the ſodaine lighting of the blowe, that either for ſome former or preſent maladie, hee was weake: by being at the ſame inſtant he was iniuried, in the preſence or priuie chamber of the Prince, or of ſome others, where he was bounde to reuerence, for doubt of inequality in party or ſuch like.</p>
               <p>It ſhould not appeare (ſayde <hi>Scandiano</hi>) if that it bee true which they intreating of Combate affirme, that the act of cowardize is excuſed by ſuſpition of vne quall partie: wherupon if one accompanied, prouoke or aſſaile another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, hee by himſelfe ſhewing cowardize, cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by inequalitie of partie, except hee ſee himſelfe fight againſt the armes of two ſeuerall men: And this their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is grounded vppon that your inwarde ſuppoſition, that euerie man is honeſt, if no action appeare to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Being therefore to imagine, that the companions of the aſſailants are iuſt, there ſhall be no reaſon to feare their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, except it appeare manifeſtly. And yet in this I am verye doubtfull, for as in generall battaile it is great aduantage, to daunt the enemie at the firſt ſight, with great number, ſo will it be in any brawle a ſpeciall aduantage,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16643:90"/>at the firſt meeting, by a multitude of complices, to ſtrike terror into an enemie alone.</p>
               <p>Say it whoſoeuer will (aunſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, or chalenge, being accompanied, one alone, is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt act, and noteth ſmall valour, although no other draw their ſwordes then the aſſailant: neither can hee defiled or aſſailed, preſume vppon ſuch honeſtie in the others compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as that the doubt of their iniuſtice ſhall not be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo that in ſuch a caſe, hee offended may alwaies excuſe himſelfe, with probable preſumption of inequalitie. That this is an action ſcarcely befitting an honourable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Arioſto</hi> declareth (ſaid Count <hi>Alfonſo</hi>) in his three and twentie <hi>Canto,</hi> ſaying.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>They would full faine haue gone, but of their companie</l>
                  <l>The Count accepted not: though honeſt twere and good:</l>
                  <l>And with this reaſon ſtraight, hee did them ſatisfie:</l>
                  <l>That in a warriour no diſgrace was vnderſtood:</l>
                  <l>Like as, when to the field his foe hee doth defie,</l>
                  <l>And brings for aide and helpe, a friend, or ſtander by.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But to returne to our purpoſe of peace, although the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule you haue ſette downe, concerning entreatie of peace bee good, yet reſt I not ſatisfied, except you alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede vnto poynts particular, the which (though vnto you Sir Knight, it ſeeme impoſsible to comprehend, the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents beeing in a manner ſo infinite) yet in my iudgement, they may bee reduced vnder twoo principall heades, as likewiſe all iniuries and offences. For either they bee iniuries of woords, or deedes: diſpleaſe it not you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to anſwere, and deliuer your opinion, to ſuch demands as ſhall bee propounded, touching the concluſion of peace: And <hi>Gualin:</hi> Although this argument requireth longer and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16643:91"/>deeper conſideration, notwithſtanding, as taken ſodainelie, I will endeuour to giue you ſatiffaction, and if I do no other good, yet ſhall giue you occaſion, to meditate better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Put caſe (added <hi>Turcho</hi>) that one had iniuried by words, reproouing another of iniuſtice or vility: and if that he iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, returned it not with a lie, but ſwallowed vp this iniury: in what word could the offender reſtore honour, ſo as hee himſelfe might not be touched? The generall rule in this caſe, as in alother, may ſerue the turne (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) For it the offender offered not iniurie in colde bloud, which is called an innocent and inexpected chance, as manie times it happeneth, playing, talking, or diſcuſsing any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in ſuch a caſe we may attribute the fault to anger: for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as the Pholoſopher affirmeth in the firſt of his Ethicks, mitigateth greatly the offence of iniuſtice, in that it ſeemeth the beginning of action, proceedeth not from him angrie, but from the other, gining the occaſion of anger: but if hee did it in cold bloud, which is termed a caſe premeditate, it may be excuſed by ignorance. In the firſt caſe the offender, ſhall ſay to the iniutied, I ouercome with the furie of anger, and being without the bondes of reaſon, iniuried you thus, or thus in wordes: now taking you for an honeſt man, and vnworthy of contempt, penitent for whatſoeuer I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to your diſhonour, I requeſting you to be my friend: The iniuried may anſwer: Seeing you know mee for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-man, and repent you of what you haue ſpoken to my diſhonour, I accept you as my friend. The firſt words disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the offender, in that the ſinne of incontinence, though it abſolutely deſerue not pardon, yet neuertheleſſe, it is woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of excuſe, being a verie difficult matter to reſiſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but eſpecially anger.</p>
               <p>The laſt remooue ſuſpition of vilitie from the iniuried: in the ſeconde caſe, the offender ſhall ſay, I through falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or probable coniecture, entred into opinion, that you were ſuch or ſuch an one: but now aſſured of trueth, I know you to be an honeſt man, and vnwoorthie of contempt:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16643:91"/>wherefore repenting me of whatſoeuer to your diſhonor I haue ſpoken, I deſire that you will be vnto me a friend: the firſt wordes ſhewing, that the offender erred, excuſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice: and the laſt worke the like effect, as in the firſt caſe, that is, they cleare and diſcharge him iniuried.</p>
               <p>And if he ſſaundered, (added <hi>Beuelacqua</hi>) anſwer the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation with a lie, howe would you introduce peace: for according to <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> it ſeemes this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be done, except the iniurier eat his words: &amp; thus doing, he accuſeth himſelfe to be malignant &amp; a liar, and ſo reſteth infamous. And <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linguo:</hi> The opinions of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> in the ſubiect of honor are ſo ſtrict, as ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on his foundations, there can no peace be introduced, but that one muſt remaine infamous, which is falſe: for whenſoeuer in peace it is manifeſted, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was not voluntarily performed, neither by election, but rather through humane fragility, the offender reſteth not infamous, although the lawes ſuffer not offences throgh ignorance to ſcape vnpuniſhed, or whoſoeuer vppon any other affection of the minde committed. This ſhall take no place betweene particular men, to whom the recouery on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of honor, is ſufficient. Therefore we will affirme, that ſuch a like quarrel may after this ſort be accommodated. The gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the he, ſhall ſay thus: being certified, that you euill informed by one that hateth mee, ſpoke thus iniuriouſly of me, I confeſſe, that notwithſtanding you haue reported that of me, which is not true, yet haue you not lied, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perceiuing you to be a man of valor, and honor, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you to be friends with mee. Hee offered the lye ſhall anſwere, I truly wrong informed, and beleeuing that you were ſuch an one, vttered of you theſe iniurious ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but nowe confe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſsing my errour, I knowe you for an honorable and honeſt man, contenting my ſelfe to bee your friend.</p>
               <p>Declare vnto mee (ſaide <hi>Beuelacqua</hi>) how in this the honour of the one and other is ſatisfied: And <hi>Gualin:</hi> The wordes of the firſt lie-giuer, haue ſatisfied him offered
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:16643:92"/>the lie, becauſe they declare, that hee ſpoke that which in his conceit hee beleeued to bee true, although through ignoraunce as cuill informed hee ſpoke ſlaunderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And the woordes of him offered the lie, remooue the calumniation obiected to the Lie giuer, ſeeing confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that hee is an honeſt man, he ſecretly, and by an honeſt meane, reuoketh his ſaying. Me thinkes, ſaide <hi>Calcagnino,</hi> that in accommodating this quarrel, you proceed contratie to that you ought: for as from the ſlaunderer the quarrell had originall, ſo ought hee alſo to bee the firſt, in ſpeech of reconciliation, yet you ſet downe the contrarie. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> You muſt obſerue, that in the action of making peace, they proceed contrarie to that courſe in combate; for in combate, the firſt aduancement or ſetting forwarde commeth from the aſſailant, as hee that ſeeketh to recouer honour; but in effecting peace, the firſt to mooue and ſpeake, ought to bee the defendant, as hee, that hath to reſtore honour: further then this, if the ſlaunderer ſhould firſt ſpeake, it would follow, that he of himſelfe ſhoulde come to giue ſatisfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke his ſpeeches, which could not but turne to his great ſhame, as <hi>Faustus</hi> ſaith. And if hee firſt iniurying (ſayd <hi>Turcho</hi>) ſhould anſwer the lie with a boxe on the eare, or other blow, what plaiſter might bee founde out fit for the ripening of this impoſtume?</p>
               <p>Although a blowe on the eare, anſwered <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly taketh away the lie (as hath beene ſayde) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie of deede not being ſufficient proofe to ſhew, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hath committed a particular offence, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally it noteth him ſtrucken worthie of contempt: yet not ſwaruing from this common abuſe which raigneth, according to which, hee that ſuffereth ſuch an iniurie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth infamous, peace (in my opinion) may by theſe wordes be laboured and procured. Lette vs therefore ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the iniurying hadde ſaide to the iniuried: Thou art a traytour: and after, hauing receiued the lie, hee had
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16643:92"/>giuen a box on the eare, or offered ſome offence of deede, and deſirous to reſtore honour againe, hee ſhall ſay thus: I beeing wrong informed, entred into wrong opinion, that you were a traitour, and therefore the other day I told you that you were the ſame, as alſo I ſtrucke you: now being perſwaded of the trueth, I confeſſe that you are no Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, wherefore eſteeming you for an honeſt man, and as one that will vrge ſome reuenge vppon mee, as well for my iniurie doone vnto you in wordes, as alſo for the other in deede, and repenting my ſelfe heartily in hauing ſo ſore offended you, I do requeſt, that you will be vnto mee a friend.</p>
               <p>May it therefore pleaſe you, (ſayde Count <hi>Iulio</hi>) to make knowne the force of all thoſe ſimples that doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this playſter; for when the vertue of the ſimples ſhall bee vnderſtoode, it will afterwardes bee the more eaſie to apply them to other infyrmities: It is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a good Phyſition (aunſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) to knowe the ſimples, but further, it is requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that hee doe vnderſtand the infirmitie, minding to heale it: and therefore before wee proceede any further, lette vs firſt of all examine the quarrell; which is the note of infirmitie in the offender, and alſo in the iniuried: In this quarrell therefore, on the offenders parte there is a great want of iuſtice, and on the parte of him iniuried, defect of valour, not wythout ſuſpition of iniuſtice: out of doubt it is great want of iuſtice to iniurie an other, firſt, with wordes full of vntrueth, which by the other mans lie is manifeſted, and afterwardes with deede for ſuſtentation of his ſlaunder.</p>
               <p>And to ſupport ſuch an iniurie, is want of valour, for by not attempting iuſt reuenge, it is further ſuſpected leſt the defect of iuſtice by the iniurier to him obiected be true; it is therefore requiſite to find out ſimples, which together compounded, may haue vertue contrary to theſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, conſiddering that contraries by contraries are oft
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16643:93"/>times cured: and theſe former recited, ſhal be the wordes of him firſt offending, which correſpondent to the quality of the dogs skinne, ſhal be of force to heale this wound and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and to the ende wee may diſtinctly conſider of them, let vs diuide them into three partes.</p>
               <p>The firſt wordes therefore vttered, are of vertue to cure the lie: for they make known that the iniurier hath ſpoken vntruth, he beleeuing otherwiſe: and that he notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding erred ſpoke but according to his minde, yet being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. The ſecond, which beginne: now perſwaded or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the truth, are of force to remooue ſuſpition of the treaſon to him iniuried obiected: the reſt of the words, wipe out al ſuſpition of vility in him iniuried, and manifeſt, that he is not worthy of contempt, as alſo that the offender, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent for his vniuſt fact, through error committed. There is no doubt teplied <hi>Turcho,</hi> but the offender, by ſaying, that he iniuried, was a man likely to reuenge any iniurie, did free him offended from ſuſpition of puſillanimitie: but thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I can not perceiue, how the iniurier ſhould not remain greatly preiudiced in honor; for after a cloſe manner hee confeſſeth, that he iniuried, is a man ready to redouble the blows: the which is confirmed by his laſt words of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſeeing he requeſteth him to be his friend: and as for me, I thinke it as much, as if he had ſaide, becauſe I knowe you will beſtow vppon mee ſome baſtanadoes, or blowes, I requeſt, you not to offend me, but to be my friend. If to be reuenged, ſaid <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> were alwaies the ſelfe ſame, as to giue baſtanadoes or blows, you ſhould conclude well; but the matter ſtandeth not ſo, for it may furder bee thought, that to carrie an iniurie in n inde, is to ſeeke reuenge of the receiued wrong by his own proper valor, ſhewing vnto the worlde, that he iniuried is not worthy of contempt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is an action of fortitude, which principally is a vertue of the mind, &amp; not of the body, it ſufficeth in ſuch an action, to ſhew animoſitie and crourage, accompanying it with that force, which nature to the body hath adminiſtred,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16643:93"/>how great or little ſoeuer it bee: and therefore ſuch an one ſhalbe ſaide to haue attempted iuſt reuenge of an iniurie, ſpeaking according to common Vſe, and that by his owne proper valor he hath by al meanes contended after reuenge, although either in force inferior to his aduerſary, or by ſome other ſiniſter accident, he could not performe his wiſhed deſire: for the action of fortitude conſiſteth not in ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming, but in fighting reſolutely for an honeſt cauſe: the offender therefore affirming, that the iniuried is a man ſufficient enough to ſeeke reuenge of the receiued iniurie, doth not for all this priuiely confeſſe, that hee is a man that will redouble vpon him the blowe, or giue him ſome wound; for it may further be vnderſtood that he confeſſeth, and knoweth him a man ſufficient to call in queſtion, or make trial of reuenge, with his owne proper valor through the vertue of fortitude which is in him: ſo that theſe words, though they reſtore honour to the iniuried, yet cauſe they not the offender to be infamous, as alſo it no waies toucheth his credit, to entreat at his handes, peace: for he may bee there vnto moued, not ſo much for feare, as through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſire euery wiſe man hath, to purchaſe vnto himſelfe rather friendes then enemies.</p>
               <p>Wee therefore ſuppoſing, that in compounding peace, honor cannot equally be diſpenced, and therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that ſome fallation be vſed; theſe wordes are moſt proper, for in that they may bee interpreted with diuers ſence, they are the apter to ſatisfie, each of the parties, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a conſtruction according to their purpoſe: and note thus much, that in procuring peace, it is of ſpeciall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to find out words of like ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for with their plau ſibilitie manie times, they make that bitter venime, inſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible, which infecteth honor: and therefore whoſoeuer deſireth to bring peace to a good end, it is neceſſary he contend more in this, then in any other thing. This is an excellent aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſaide <hi>Turcho</hi>) but how would you appeaſe a quarrel, where the iniurie of wordes is not retourned with a lie, but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16643:94"/>with deede? as for example, if the offender ſaying to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried, thou art a murderer, he iniuried at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhoulde anſwere him with a blow, and not with a lie.</p>
               <p>Although this bee an improper meane of returning ſuch a like iniurie (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) yet deſirous to make peace, he that gaue the blow ſhal ſay thus: I hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that you rather ſubdued by force of anger, then by any euil diſpoſition of mind, called me murderer, repent my ſelfe that I ſtrooke you, ſeeing I acknowledge you for a man of valour, and ſufficient to ſeeke reuenge of the iniurie I did you: and therefore requeſt that you will be my friend. The other ſhall thus anſwere: I confeſſe, that ouercome by anger, I wrongfully called you murderer, &amp; ſeeing you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of valor, &amp; ſufficient to make reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the iniury you did me, requeſting my friendſhip, I am contented to come to peace, &amp; to be your friend. Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les theſe words are of great force (added <hi>Turcho</hi>) in that they can appeaſe ſo great a quarrel. And <hi>Gua:</hi> to the end you may conceiue their force, you ſhall note, that hee firſt iniurying, hath put his honor to compromiſe, through ſuſpition of two defects, the one is that of iniuſtice, becauſe hee offendeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in word, and the other is by defect of valor, becauſe he putteth vp a blow: &amp; the firſt iniuried being the ſccond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurier, reſteth in ſuſpition of ſome murder: for the blowe, though it note the firſt offender worthie of contempt, yet doth it not deny his obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of murder, nor tie him any waies to auerre his ſaying, although by putting vp the blow, it vrge him to chalenge &amp; aſſault, enforcing him neceſſarily to make known to the world, that he is not a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthy of conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt: It is requiſite therfore, for the taking vp of quarels, to find out a meane, &amp; words as apt as may be, for diſsipation both of the one and other ſuſpition: &amp; therefore the firſt words excuſe the iniuſtice of the firſt offender, becauſe it declareth that the offence was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather through inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinency, he iniuried not hauing had the power to reſiſt anger, amongſt al the affections of the mind, the moſt viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and furious. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d words vttered alſo touching the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16643:94"/>firſt offender, annihilate the ſuſpition of vilitie in him, in that they affirm he is a man of valor, &amp; ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge himſelfe of the iniurie. Then thoſe words which by the firſt offender and laſt iniuried, are for anſwere produced, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuſpition of the murder obiected; So that by this mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, the impoſtume is lenified, &amp; finally, healed, which ſeemed at the firſt ſight altogither incurable, except with fire or ſword. I iudge the quariel far more grieuous (ſaid Count <hi>Guido</hi>) when the lie-giuer anſwereth the bexe on the eare, with a wound or blow, becauſe iniuries then redouble of each partie, although the firſt offender and laſt offender remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with vantage of honor. And <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> Although this infirmitie ſeem incurable, notwithſtanding this ſhall bee a conuenient remedie, if the giuer of the lie, being alſo he that woundeth, ſhall ſay thus, after this manner: I being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that you euill informed, vttered of me ſuch an iniurious ſpeech, confeſſe that you haue not ſpoken againſt your mind, yet I entend not that the lie I gaue you, ſhould any way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice you in your honour, and knowing you for a man of valor, and ſufficient to be mindfull of the wound I gaue you, or of any other iniurie I haue done you, penitent for my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I humbly requeſt you to bee my friend. The other ſhal ſay thus: It is true that euil informed, I ſpoke ſo iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of you, but ſeeing you confeſſe I haue not lied, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me for a man of valour, &amp; ſufficient to reuenge my ſelf of the wound you gaue me, as alſo penitent for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of me, you hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly require peace, I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to bee your friend. Now I comprehend the vertue of theſe words (ſaid <hi>Turcho</hi>) &amp; beleeue that we haue in a maner ſatisfied al occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in theſe contentions, if you would but only ſhew how a quarrel might be taken vp, where onely an iniurie of deed hath hapned. In this quarrel (anſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) the honor of the iniurier ſtandeth doubtful, for the ſuſpition there is of his failing in iuſtice, as alſo the honour of him iniuried, through preſumption of cowardize: or that he is worthy of conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt; it is requiſite therfore to excogitate words, that may excuſe or remoue the ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the one &amp; the other defect:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16643:95"/>and in my iudgement, they may be of this tenour: when I did you ſuch an iniurie, I tooke you for a wicked man, and worthy of contempt: Noweſufficiently perſwaded of your integritie, and knowing you to be a man of valour, as alſo ſufficient to reuenge the iniurie by me receiued, penitent for what I haue doone vnto you, I deſire that you will bee my friend. He iniuried ſhall aunſwer: Seeing acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging your errour, you repute me for an honeſt man, and ſufficient to reuenge the iniurie by you receiued, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo penitent for offending mee, requeſt that I will bee your friend, I am content to haue peace with you. By the words which you haue declared in other quarrelles (ſaid <hi>Beue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacqua</hi>) it is eaſie to comprehend the force of theſe other: notwithſtanding I am deſirous you would ſhew the reaſon, why in theſe treaties of peace, you neuer vſe this worde, to Pardon, confidering, that vnto him iniuried, it would bee greater ſatisfaction, when the iniurier ſhould ſay, I requeſt that you would pardon mee, than to ſay, I pray you be my friend. It is true (ſaide <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) that to him iniuried, it would be greater ſatisfaction, but ſo it ſhould be too great preiudice to the iniurier; becauſe it is ſuppoſed, that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of puniſhment is in the Pardoners hand: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the offender ſhould priuily come to confeſſe, that hee iniuried were farre ſuperiour vnto him, and that at his pleaſure he could chaſten him, hauing no other remedie but to craue pardon: and therefore equallitie in peace by all meanes poſsible being to be procured, that other maner of ſpeach is farre more conuenient, conſidering that to contend after friendſhippe with his enemie, ſuppoſeth ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cowardize nor feare.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes, ſayde Count <hi>Scandiano,</hi> wee haue left out one kinde of quarrell, which peraduenture ſhould haue bin the firſt according to order, and it is that, where the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are like: for ſometimes it falleth out, that betwixt the one and other party, iniurious words paſſe without any lie giuen: or elſe that the one and other reſteth equally ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16643:95"/>or wounded, ſo that I pray you, fayle not, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate alſo this quarrell. Some men holde opinion (aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) that in ſuch like brawles there is no impediment, but to make a good peace, conſidering that honour by them is ſo counterpoyſed, as the one remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not in the others debt: Notwithſtanding I holde this for a firme concluſion, that by exchange there can no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable peace bee made, and much leſſe in this quarrell, wherein, as the iniuries be equall, ſo is the diſhonour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them equall, and therefore I iudge it neceſſary, that as they haue diſhonoured one another, ſo that interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably by wordes, they reſtore honor: therefore in comming to peace, hee from whom the brawle had his originall ſhal ſay thus: In that I know you for an honeſt and valiant man, it grieueth me of whatſoeuer hath paſſed betwixt vs, and I requeſt you to bee my friend. The other ſhall anſwere: I hauing alſo of you the like opinion, and minding well vnto you, gricued for what betwixt vs hath happened, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bee your friend. In my iudgement, this is a good meane to take vp ſuch a quarrel, (ſaid Count <hi>Alfonſo Turcho</hi>) but to the purpoſe of theſe iniuries: there yet commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my minde one doubt, whether one challenged to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of equall armes, may with his honour refuſe, knowing himſelfe in force and skill of weapon inferior to his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: By one reaſon me thinkes hee ſhould; for God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not hauing equally diſpenſed their graces: but vnto one man giuen greater perfection than to an other: a man as hauing reaſon ought to meaſure himſelfe, and giue place to the other in that, wherein he knoweth himſelfe inferior, the which not doing, he performeth not a vertuous action, and conſequently, doth not preſerue, but looſeth his honour, as raſh and arrogant: on the other ſide, if that be true, which <hi>Poſſeuino</hi> affirmeth, a man is bound to manifeſt as great force and pollicie as the other, and enioyned to defend him ſelfe from the ſame enemie, in all other circumſtances ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing indifferencie: I therefore in this, ſir Knight, expect
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16643:96"/>your opinion. And <hi>Gualin:</hi> Suppoſing that the challenger haue iuſt cauſe ſo to do; for being otherwiſe, any one, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is to be refuſed, &amp; ſuppoſing, that he challenged be an Armiger, intending by ſuch an one, not only a ſouldier, but any one that beareth armes by his ſide, I holde opinion that he challenged, cannot with his honor, refuſe the triall of armes with his aduerſary, althogh in force and knowledge he know him to be ſuperior; for as <hi>Zenophon</hi> a Philoſopher, and moſt excellent warriour affirmeth, the ſword and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune maketh in battaile all force equall. And this opinion taketh not place only in general battaile, but alſo in combat, betweene particular men: in which, by diuers examples, both ancient and of theſe daies it hath beene ſeene, that the weake hath obtained victorie againſt the ſtrong, either by hauing more mortally wounded them, or by ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. This other reaſon is annexed; that the challenged by al reaſon hath euer prouoked the challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger by ſome offence; wherevppon as the other hath beene bolde in prouoking him, ſo he challenged muſt not ſhew himſelfe cowardlike in refuſing: &amp; therefore I conclude, that one bearing armes, cannot refuſe with honor the challenge of any one whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, although he know himſelfe in force and knowledge inferior to his aduerſarie.</p>
               <p>Your concluſion pleaſeth mee (ſaide Count <hi>Alfonſo Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>) becauſe it is conformable to the rules of knighthoode, and common vſe, notwithſtanding from it, me thinks there groweth an inconuenience, for the vnarmed touching ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhall bee of farre better condition then he bearing armes, as he that iniurying, is yet free from challenge: and by this meanes the way of recouering honour with proper valor, will be ſhut vp tp him bearing armes, as further then ſo, the tearmes of iuſtice, would not bee equally obſerued: For the bearer of armes ſhall bee tied to the tryall of armes, and the vnarmed free. When <hi>Gualinguo:</hi> if that law which commaundeth the plaintife to appeare before the tribunall of the defendant be true, there is no inconuenience will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of my concluſion: for he bearing armes, ſhall be tyed to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16643:96"/>to leaue his own tribunall, being the proofe of arms, &amp; haue recourſe for recouerie of his honour, to the magiſtrates, and ſeat iuditial, it being the proper tribunal of thoſe, that make no profesſion of armes, and doing otherwiſe, hee ſhoulde rather diminiſh then augment his owne honor, and though the Armiger bearing of armes cannot refuſe, neither ſeate of iudgement, nor tribunall of armes, yet is not his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this the worſe: Firſt becauſe the ſeat of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is common to all men: ſecondly, for that the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of armes, is proper to himſelfe. Put wee the caſe (ſaid <hi>Beuelacqua</hi>) one vnaccuſtomed to beare armes, ſhoulde challenge another of vnlike condition, could he challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, with his honour refuſe the defiance, or ſhould he bee bound, vppon equall termes, to come to proofe of armes? Iudgement ſeate (anſwered <hi>Gualin.</hi>) belonging both to the one and other, the defendant is not onely, not bounde to the challenge, but accepting of it, hee ſhoulde performe an act vnworthy of a vertuous or honorable man, and ſhew him ſelf no leſſe inſolent, &amp; fooliſh, then his aduerſarie: therfore thoſe quarrels that fal out between ſuch like men, are to be determined, either with peace, or before the magiſtrates, &amp; as the lawes commaund; for though honor be common to al men, as alſo the preſeruation of it, by meanes honorable is as common, yet bee thoſe means very diuers, according to the ſundry conditions and profeſsions of men. The gentlemen were not yet well ſatisfied, with reaſoning of thoſe things pertaining to honor; when the ducheſſe dwarf came ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning in, who by order from his highnes, went calling of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; Knights to a comody prepared by the <hi>Geloſi.</hi> The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe therfore ended, <hi>Gua.</hi> with foure other knights we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hal where was his highnes, with al the ladies &amp; gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of the court: And after hauing attended, with much laughter and ſolace a moſt pleaſant comedy, it being nowe late, the tables were ſpred; &amp; ſupper ended, certaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures once troden, the duke roſe vp, &amp; euery one went to his lodging. The day following, being fair wether, &amp; a calm ſea,</p>

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:16643:97"/>His highneſſe with the excellent Ducheſſe, &amp; part of the court, went to the ſea ſide to ſee a draught with the nets, and the vſuall company, with the moſt noble Lord <hi>Don Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare,</hi> and the marqueſſe of <hi>Carrara,</hi> who had taken great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the diſcourſe of honor, went to the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame the Counteſſe, where according to accuſtomed ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Lady <hi>Syluia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa</hi> was crowned Queene: euen nowe lately married, &amp; a yong Gentlewoman exceeding gracious, who cauſing the Ladies and Knights to ſit round about her, ſpoke in this manner.</p>
               <p>Vndoubtedly my error ſhould be verie great, if I (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being but a child) by impoſing newe lawes to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, ſhould withdraw my ſelfe from the accuſtomed manner. For this would be no other, but by too much preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of my ſelfe, to eclipſe the commendation of theſe three Queenes my predeceſſors, whereof deſeruedly they may boaſt and vaunt, who in their Empire procured no leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and honeſt, then delightſome and pleaſing entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: whereupon by their moſt happie furtherance, wee haue learned what thing beautie is, and where it conſiſteth: wee alſo know what Loue is, and how we ought to loue: wee haue in like manner vnderſtood what Honour is, and how it is loſt, how acquired, and how preſerued: which things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wel conſidered with my ſelf, I cannot but greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their wonderful iudgement, ſeeing they haue labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with our great contentment, to giue vs knowledge in thoſe things, whereof aboue all others, they diſcuſſe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue in Courts, amongſt Ladies &amp; Gentlemen nobly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: I therefore deſiring by imitation of their famous ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, not to manifeſt my ſelfe altogither vnwoorthie of this Empire, haue conſidered, that after honour, it befitteth well to intreate of Nobilitie, to the end, that wee neuer erre in diſcerning thoſe Noble, from the Ignoble. For it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that riches and ſumptuous veſtments, are the principal caracters of Nobilitie, we ſeeing euerie day, that the riche appearing in coſtly Robes, make profeſsion of Gentilitie.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16643:97"/>And with bold audacitie, (not to ſay preſumption) eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing themſelues in Princes Courts, are ſodainely without any other vertue, as Noble, reuerenced, called, &amp; accepted: I commaund you therefore Signior <hi>Hercole Varrani,</hi> that in fauour of me, as alſo of all theſe Ladies and Gentlemen, you vſe ſome diſcourſe vpon Nobility, withal, prouiding your ſelfe to reſolue all the doubts, and anſwere al the demaundes that in ſuch an argument ſhall be made vnto you: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely Signior <hi>Hercole Varrani,</hi> is a Gentleman adorned with al thoſe qualities, which in a perfect Courtier are principally required.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16643:98"/>vp: and if notwithſtanding there were any ſuch thing, in the worlde, it was no whit at all diſtinguiſhed from vertue, but that the man vertuous and noble, was all one and the ſelfe ſame thing: vpon which point hauing meditated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcuſſe of Nobilitie, not to perplexe the minde and vnderſtanding of the attendant, I will deuide this my briefe diſcourſe into three partes. Firſt, I will ſhew what Nobility is, and where it conſiſteth; in the ſecond, I will ſet downe the principall reaſons of thoſe philoſophers, who contemne it as a thing vaine and fantaſticall: and in the third, I will make anſwere, and reſolue them, to the end our Nobilitie may remaine moſt noble and apparent. I ſuppoſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in certaine indiuidualles of humane kinde, there ſhineth an excellent qualitie which is termed Nobilitie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it is, no other, then a good of fortune, that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to man in his firſt originall and birth, procured vnto him, by the honorable repuration of his predeceſſors, and glorie of his countrie: by meanes of which it is worthyly ſuppoſed, that he is much more capable and appliant vnto vertue, then another can be, borne of mechanicall parents, in a countrie obſcure. This by a moſt proper terme, was by the Grecians called <hi>Eugenia,</hi> which ſignifieth liberall and good birth, or originall; conformable to that worde, wee vſealſo, to call them noble, well borne. I haue affirmed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to be a good of fortune, not becauſe nature therein hath no part, but in that, as the Philoſopher teacheth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of thoſe thinges is ſaide to be the occaſion, which fall out contrarie to the intention of the worker; being therfore nature intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in framing man, to make a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; not one noble, of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature is the cauſe, &amp; fortune of nobility. And I haue placed in the definition, that other clauſe, honorable reputation of his predeceſſors, as a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſpecificall, which diſtinguiſheth this good called No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, from all other goods externall, as likewiſe the laſt wordes of all, are by me ſet downe, to expreſſe in this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, not only the cauſe materiall, formall, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16643:98"/>but alſo the finall: in that Nobilitie, is for no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, by all men had in price and eſtimation, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he noble ſeemeth borne with a better inclination, and diſpoſition vnto verrue, then a plebeyan, or one extracted from the common ſorte. He therefore ſhall bee eſteemed more apt vnto vertue, and ſhall be called truly noble, who legitimately deſcendeth, from men, and women excellent, &amp; famous, either for riches, or thoſe things that moſt among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are eſteemed, &amp; that ſhall haue had many of his race in euery age, &amp; of each ſex, honorable &amp; renouned, or that ſhal bee borne in a Cittie built and repleniſhed, with men heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and glorious: where vppon the greater haue beene the number of his commendable progenitors, the more noble ſhall he be. Neuertheleſſe, hee may bee called abſolutely noble, who ſhall haue loſt the memory of his ignobilitie, which memorie remaineth, during the reuolution of three generations: and let this ſpoken ſuffice, to make knowne, that neither riches, nor ſumptuous veſtimentes make a man noble, but further it is neceſſarie, that the renowne of his progenie, therevnto concurre: for hee borne of mechanicall parentes, although neuer ſo rich, cannot come within the compaſſe of this definition: which defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, notwithſtanding it bee well grounded, yet by ſome Philoſophers, and eſpecially by the Stoickes, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together derided, whoſe reaſons hauing foundation vpon great probabilitie, are in no ſorte to bee contemned; They ſay therefore, that all wee ſpringing from a common roote, which is God, principall goodnes, and higheſt nobility; euery one, though vulgarly extracted, is noble, when not degenerating from his firſt progenitor, hee practiſeth vertue: whereas on the contrarie, hee is truly ignoble, who, notwithſtanding hee deſcended from the auncient <hi>Heroes,</hi> degenerating, addicteth himſelfe to vice: as <hi>Boetius</hi> affirmeth in ſome of his verſes: which in our tong, ſound after this manner.</p>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:16643:99"/>Furthermore they alleadge: Nature is a kind mother to all, and a ſtepmother to none, neither ſhutteth ſhee vp the way of vertue, more to one than another: but maketh euery one apt to attaine to his proper end, which is felicity: neither doth <hi>Scythia,</hi> or any other barbarous region, preiudice mans ſoule; but which is more, if the world were eternall, we are equally placed, in the ſame courſe and way of eternitie. If that had his beginning from our firſt Father (as no doubt but it had) we al likewiſe from the ſame firſt father haue our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and originall: which being true, it is madneſſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that one offpring is more noble then another: and they who puffed vp with vaine ambition, boaſt of Nobilitie, may rather be called fooles, than men noble; they argue alſo from the inconueniences that would enſue, if nobilitie were grounded on the honor of progenie: for firſt it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſay they, that the firſt vertuous man of a familie, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ignoble, ſhould be the foundation of an other mans nobilitie, a thing repugnant vnto reaſon; for then that axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome, by al the Vniuetſities confirmed, ſhould be falſe, which is this: Whatſoeuet is the cauſe, that any other thing is as it is, muſt much more be the ſame it ſelfe: as for example: if fire be the cauſe that all things haue heate, that of al other muſt needes be hote. Neyther preuaileth it to alledge, that the like happeneth to him who is the beginning of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as doth to the poynt with vnitie: conſidering, that thogh the one being the beginning of quantitie continuall, and the other of diſcreete quantitie, yet is there neyther continuall quantitie found in the poynt, nor quantitie diſcreete in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for nobilitie which is a qualitie of humane excellence, hath nothing to doe with poynt, nor vnitie, which are in a diuerſe kinde: as further than this, vnitie is comprehended in number; conſidering that without, one, there can not be twenty, neither can the line, ſuperficies, or body, be without poynt, whereupon in the number of many men noble, that cauſe nobility, he firſt muſt neceſſarily be comprehended, who ought to be ſo much more noble than others, in that he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16643:100"/>was the author of nobilitie, &amp; renowne of al the others. And moreouer, it would followe quite contrary to the rule of the Ciuilians, that one might giue to another, that which he hath not himſelfe: and that he being obſcure, might reach honor to another, a thing altogether diſproportionable, and diſſen ting from reaſon: It is not therefore to be ſaid, that nobilitie proceeds from antiquity of bloud: for if that were ſo, the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that holy man ſhould be tru, that nobilitie were alied to brickes and tiles, ſeeing our originall alſo is of the earth. Laſt of all, they vrge that ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is the halſe of the whole; which being true how ſhould not he be noble, that is the beginning of an other mans no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, if on him alone depend the ſcope and end of all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? with theſe &amp; other ſuch like reaſons, thoſe wiſe men conclude, that nobilitie cannot be the renowne of progenie: but that by vertue of it ſelfe it is faſhioned: in confirmation of which opinion <hi>Dant</hi> ſayth:
<q>That only he is excellent, who by himſelfe doth ſhine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this. I am of opinion, that our concluſion, and definition of nobility is true, and the reaſons of theſe Philoſophers vaine, and ſophiſticall, which at the firſt ſight appeare to be of no ſmall moment. Firſt therfore obſerue we, that as terms and bounds manifeſt that to ſenſe, where of any one is poſſeſſour, ſo definition (called of the Graecians by a moſt proper name <hi>Oriſmi</hi>) which in our tong importes bounds or termes, procure intellect diſtinctly to conceiue the proper eſſence, of euery thing, vnto which the Perepateticke hauing had an eye, of all Philoſophers the moſt ſedulous, laboured, vndoubtedly with admirable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, of althings to finde out the definitions, conſidering that this is the true foundation of Sciences, it adminiſtring the middle terme to perfect demonſtration, as the Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans very wel effect: As therfore al things in our mind by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, are wel ordained, &amp; diſtinguiſhed, ſo from the ſame minde definition remoued, there is procured a moſt notable
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16643:100"/>confuſion altogether like that, which in the beginning of the world, the Poets fabuloſly called <hi>Chaos:</hi> Therfore it was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the diuine philoſopher in Phedro, aproued by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> in the firſt of his Offices, that they who would entreate of any thing, ſhould beginne from the definition: which being true, as it is, ſo they that haue intreated of matters with out defining them, haue rather bred in the mindes of others groſſe ignorance, then diſtinct &amp; abſolute knowledge. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that from good definition the ſolution of all doubtes which occurre in ſcience ſpringeth. Into this error many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſophers, and diners moderne writers are fallen: and amongſt others, touching this ſubiect we now haue in hande, the error of <hi>Mutius Iuſtinopolitane,</hi> (a witte que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe verie rare) is inexcuſable: who refuſing the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers definition of Nobilitie, hath himſelfe thereof giuen no definition at all, which may make it diſtinct in kinde, from other things: wherefore, labouring to ſhewe contradiction and error in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> hee hath diſcouered himſelfe to bee but vaine, and rather a profeſſor of the lawes, then a good Philoſopher. But further, lette vs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue lines, which beginning from one center, extende to the circumference in the ſame center, &amp; are both one thing, and diuers: ſo al things created, as from God they take their beginning, bee all one, but in reſpect to diuers formes they be ordained, they bee diuers. If wee therefore conſider things created in their beginning, which is God, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, as theſe wiſe men affirme, but all other thinges alſo, are equally good, noble, and excellent: but if wee conſider them according to their exterior formes and kinds, they are betweene themſelues verie diuers: and therefore the Philoſopher in his Diuine Philoſophie, ſayth, that kindes bee like numbers, minding to inferre, that as numbers in vnitie bee the ſelfe ſame thing, neither dooth the one exceede the other in perfection, but when from vnitie they are ſeperate, and faſhioned in kinde, one is then more perfect and excellent then another. So all the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16643:101"/>kindes of things, in their beginning are the ſame, but once framed into forme, are diuers: further more let vs note (and from hence groweth the error of the Stoicke, and his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers) that this bountie, excellence, and this their originall Nobility, as by proper vertue it cannot be acquired, ſo may it not by vice bee loſt, and therefore <hi>Lucifer</hi> conſidered in his firſt inſtant nature, is no leſſe perfect and noble then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther angels: for his ſinne doth not procure, but as other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſo he hath had his originall from God. Which errour they had very wel preuented if they had beene circumſpect, and ſought after the definition of Nobilitie, which is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemable condition, that in ſome indiuidualles of humane kinde is found: for willing to haue defined it, they ſhould not haue ſaide, that Nobilitie was an excellent qualitie in al things created, depending on their beginning which is god, the father of all thinges, and that in thoſe thinges it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, when they abandon not the firſt roote and ſtocke, nor practiſe not Vice: for they might haue perceiued, that in this definition, there is a notable error, and moſt ſpeciall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuencience; the error is, that they hauing to define a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular qualitie, which in humane kinde is obſerued, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a common qualitie, which is not onely found in diuers kindes, but alſo in many things differing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in kinde: the inconuenience is great, for if their definition were good, an Aſſe ſhould bee of farre better condition, then man: in whom as neither vertue, nor vice can concurre, ſo could he neuer degenerate from his firſt ſtocke &amp; original; and ſo conſequently, ſhould euer bee noble: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, a man ſometimes vertuous, ſometimes vitious, ſhould now be noble, and anone after ignoble. <hi>Mutius</hi> ſaith, that Nobilitie conſiſteth in perfection in kinde, determining to inferre, that thoſe thinges which in their kinde are perfect, bee truly noble: the which beeing true, that creature from whoſe fleſh the Iews abſtaine, being perfect, might be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt thoſe noble: he addeth afterward, as greatly in himſelfe perplexed, that althogh he deſcended from ancient
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16643:101"/>linage be noble, yet is not he ſo diſcended, only noble, for by this meanes, ſaith he, we ſhuld infringe the power of nature and vertue, that they coulde not generate a new nobilitie. <hi>Mutius</hi> therefore contendeth to proue, that there be three ſortes of nobilitie: of the firſt, conformable to the Perepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticke, hee maketh antiquitie of bloud the auther; of the ſecond, nature, drawing neere to <hi>Seneca,</hi> who affirmeth in the place by mee cited, that he is more noble then another, whoſe diſpoſition is better, and witte more apt to libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall artes: of the third ſort, he maketh vertue productreſſe, following the opinion of <hi>Boetius,</hi> that hee is noble, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generateth not from his originall, and applieth himſelfe to vertue. This man queſtionleſſe in his profesſion learned, did not marke, that he deuiding nobilitie into two diuers kindes, hath not ſhewed nor defined the neereſt kinde, wherein they agree: for if he had examined his definition, he might eaſiely haue foreſeene, that they not being to bee reduced, vnder vniuocall kinde, and very hardly vnder ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, no more could different kindes be faſhioned, after ſuch a manner as he framed them: hee hath therefore Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleaged, that nature, or the intention of nature, may generate nobilitie, for as wee haue declared, nature of her ſelfe, is the cauſe of reaſon, and by accident of nobilitie: for if ſhe diſtribute nobilitie, as well as reaſon, all men, as they are reaſonable, ſo ſhould they be noble; but in that the cauſe of nbilitie is fortune (being a cauſe contingent) of men wee ſee ſome noble, others ignoble. That vertue is the cauſe of nobilitie we grant, but not the vertue of one alone (as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth) but rather the vertue of many: we grant alſo, that nature in reſpect of her ſelfe, is to all a kinde and louing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: notwithſtanding let vs adde, that ſhe working by ſeed, manifeſteth herſelfe a ſtep-mother to ſome: conſidering ſeed from the heauens, places, nouriſhment, and ſathers, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiueth diuers diſpoſition, ſometimes good, ſome times bad: wherevpon indiuidualles of the ſame kinde (but eſpecially in humane kinde) as they are of diuers temperatures, ſo in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16643:102"/>them ditters inclinations, and in their mindes different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and affects are diſcouered: from whence it proceedeth in reaſon, that ſome are eſteemed of noble race, and others of ignoble: ſome ingenious, others ſtupide: ſome preuaile with force of mind, and are truely worthy to command, and others be as it were lumpiſh ſturdy, with whome ſeruitude better befitteth: Vnto which the diuine Philoſopher allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſaith, that in the generation, of men, there is a mixture in ſome of gold, and thoſe are alwaies worthy to command, others haue commixtion with ſiluer, and theſe are fit, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to obey, ſometimes to commaund; the third and laſt ſort, participate with yron. Wherefore, as of al others, moſt vile, they are euer fit to ſerue, and neuer to command. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſormable to his maſter was the great Perepatitian, who ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by moſt euident reaſons, that by nature the Lord and ſeruant was allotted: Nobilitie therefore is not contrary to the lawes of Nature: Becauſe Nature made all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, common to all, and thoſe which are accidentall and contingent, ſhee left them ſubiect to inſtabilitie: for if wee ſee by experience, that in the ſonnes bodies oftentimes, the ſimilitudes of fathers, grandfathers, and great grandfathers are repreſented, why ſhould we not graunt, that in the mind with the body conioynd the like may com to paſſe? &amp; that in them the like inclination &amp; facilitie, ſomtimes vnto vertue, and otherwhiles to vice, may appeare. This for the moſt part falls out, whether the world be eternall (as the Perepatetiks falſly affirm) or by the omnipotent God created (as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines ſoundly hold) for that in the courſe of this mortal life, the variety of reaſous, cuſtoms, maner of life, noriſhments, &amp; ſuch like, make neere cauſes differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, out of which afterward diuers effects are produced: notwithſtanding, in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is worthy to be approued, that nobilitie by all men is to be had in eſtimation: for it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to reaſon, that from better the better ſhuld ſpring, the which by <hi>Horace</hi> was confirmed in theſe verſes:
<q>
                  <l>Strong men doe oftentimes children of force vpreare,</l>
                  <l>The fathers vertue, in yong heifar doth appeare:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:16643:102"/>And horſes fierce and ſtowt: for ſeely fearefull Doue.</l>
                  <l>Had not the Eagle ſure for ſire, that mounts aboue.</l>
               </q> But to proue the contrary of theſe arguents, I affirme, that it is, not onely no inconuenience, but further it is neceſſary, that the firſt vertuous of a progeny, without he himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely noble, ſhould lay the foundation of an other mans Nobilitie: and to the end my concluſion may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, we muſt conſider, that as to procure the tranſmutation of any thing into fire, it is firſt requiſite, that it acquite eight degrees of heat; ſo to make one noble, it is neceſſary, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his owne excellencie, he ioyne vnto himſelfe the glory at leaſt of iii. other lights, that is, that he be enobled by three other of his predeceſſors: whereupon, as that ſhal not be fire which retains only two or three degrees of heate, although there ſhalbe fire kindled &amp; begun, ſo ſhall not he be noble, that hath onely his owne priuate renowne to ſtand vpon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be the beginning of nobility: neither hath that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiome here any place that ſaith, whatſoeuer is the cauſe, that another thing is as it is, muſt much more be the like it ſelfe: for it hath annexed vnto it many limitations; and it may bee verefied in theſe cauſes, which of the Logicians &amp; Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are called, cauſes rotal, that is, which are of themſelues, and only cauſes: but he which is the beginning of nobilitie, is not alone the cauſe of nobility, but concurreth therin, with many other. Let vs graunt, that he as the point in continuall quantity, &amp; vnity in diſcreet, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended amongſt thoſe noble, yet not as abſolutely noble, but as he that onely hath one degree of nobilitie, being as it were the beginning: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes we alſo, that one can not giue what he hath not himſelfe; and that the firſt vertuous can not giue vnto an whole race, nobilitie: but adde wee this thereunto, that hee may giue what he hath, which is that firſt degree, with his own vertue acquired: and affirme we, that the vertuous ſon of a vertuous father, is more noble, he inioying, not only his own, but alſo his fathers glory; though this man alſo, ſtanding but vpon ii, diſcents, cannot be ſaid to be abſolutely noble, as that cannot
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16643:103"/>termed fire, which hath onely foure degrees of heate: laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſaying of the Philoſopher impugneth not our defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that the beginning is the halfe of the whole, becauſe it behooueth, wee vnderſtand it truely: hee minding to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that to giue beginning to any thing, is of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as it ſeemeth whoſoeuer hath begunne, is at the middeſt of his worke: But graunting them that this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is true, wee may conclude againſt themſelnes, that he which is halfe partaker of Nobilitie, is not wholy noble: ſo that to ſuch an one, our definition cannot be applied: which remayneth firme and immoueable, that is: that perfect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie is a good of fortune, deriued from the vertue of our progenitors, together with the countrey wherein we were borne: through which it is ſuppoſed, that hee noble borne, is more apt and diſpoſed vnto vertue than an other ignoble. For if we eſteeme the goodneſſe of diuers creatures, by their races, how much more ought wee to prognoſticate the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of men by his ſtocke, and progeny, conſidering that not onely ſecret vertue of ſeede, but alſo reaſon doth inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a man, to immitate the reuealed vertue of his progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, not to ſhewe himſelfe altogether vnworthy of their ſplendor and glory.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16643:103"/>of auarice, who ſeeth not euidently, that Nobilitie ſhould ſpring from a verie corrupt generation. Shewe vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howe it may bee that men through riches, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come famous, and be foundation of Nobilitie. And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no:</hi> As vertue without riches can very hardly appeare: hee which is poore, as the philoſopher affirmeth, not being able to accompliſh magnificent actions: ſo thoſe riches which are not the companions of vertue, cannot be founders of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: wherefore the couetous man, vſurer, and he which addicteth him ſelfe to ſordide gaine, although hee ſhoulde heape vp togither more riches then <hi>Craeſus,</hi> yet could he not of himſelfe, be beginning of Nobilitie: although the firſt deſcendant from this man, might well acquire this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if with his receiued wealth, hee ſhould couple vertue. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al this Signior <hi>Hercole</hi> (added <hi>Patritio</hi>) you make me ſuſpect this your noble born babe to be infamous, I fearing, that hee is rather an imaginatiue, then a true and lawfull ofſpring, ſeeing you are of opinion, that vertue without the ſeede of riches, ſufficeth not to better him: but if that were true, it were a wonder to poynt out one Noble, conſidering how hard a matter it is, that riches ſhuld accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie vertue: and therefore good <hi>Diogenes</hi> was wont to ſay, that Vertue could not inhabite in a Citie nor in a houſe where was riches: and the ſelfe ſame Philoſopher demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what ſort of men were moſt noble, made anſwere, the contemners of riches, glorie, and pleaſures: and <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid, that the appetite of nature was of it ſelfe incorrigible, but if aboundance of riches thereunto were added, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came altogether wilde and vnbridled: and if wee ſhall imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the wiſer Philoſophers, but eſpecially <hi>Seneca,</hi> wee may rather terme riches the mother of pride, inſolence, ambition, intemperance, then of Nobilitie: And if wee reſpect the founders of ancient Nobilitie, wee ſhall find many more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of men poore and vertuous, who deſpiſing riches, by vertue onely made their progeny illuſtrous, then of the rich vertuous: For beginning from the ancient Romanes, <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:16643:104"/>although he were poore, rather deſired triumphs, then the riches of the Samnites, hauing with maruailous greatnes of mind, reiected both the gifts, and giuers: <hi>Menenius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> who was of ſo great authoritie, that many times hee tooke vp the diſcordes betweene the Senate and the people, liued ſo poorely, as after his death, if there had not beene a common collection made amongſt the people, there had not beene ſufficient left to burie him. <hi>Attylius Regulus,</hi> a man renowned for his vertues, was ſo poore, as that he being to maintaine the warre, it was neceſsarie his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould liue at publike charge: and for this occaſion was a daughter of <hi>Cneius Scipioes</hi> married with a publike dowrie. But to make recitall alſo of the Grecian Hiſtories, <hi>Phocyon Athenian,</hi> when hee might haue made himſelfe rich with thoſe gifts offered vnto him by king <hi>Phillip,</hi> would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them: and being put in minde by the Kings Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, that hee ſhould doo well to accept of them for his children, who without riches, could hardly preſerue theyr fathers glorie. If they prooue like mee (aunſwered hee) the ſelfe ſame little field will bring them vppe, which hath raiſed mee to this dignitie, and if they reſemble me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, I deſire not that their intemperance ſhould bee nouriſhed and augmented at my charge and expence. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander Lacedemonian,</hi> who made <hi>Athens</hi> Tributarie to <hi>Sparta,</hi> was ſo poore, that after his death, his Daughters Husbande, not hauing receiued their dowries, would haue refuſed it, but that by the Magiſtrates they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to holde and keep them: <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who depriued the Lacedemonians of the principallitie of Graecia, and made his countrie free, which before, and after him, was alwayes in ſeruitude: of all the victories hee obtained, neuer tooke any thing for himſelfe, content onelie with Glorie, and was ſo indigent, that not ſufficient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found after his death for perfourmance of his obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, hee was buried at publike charge: I could bring forth infinite other examples for demonſtration, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16643:104"/>hath no part of nobilitie: the which for to auoid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixitie, I paſſe ouer with ſilence: onely I will alleage, that the Philoſopher in his Rethoricke, amongſt noble families, numbreth the deſcendentes of <hi>Socrates;</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> as hee was eſteemed for a Vertuous man, ſo was hee not rich, nor from a rich father extracted: we muſt neceſſarily ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affirme, that theſe men, adorned onely with vertue, were ignoble, in that they were not rich (which would be an exceeding paradox) or elſe that onely vertue, and not riches is ſhee, that maketh a familie noble. The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I haue ſet downe of Nobilitie (ſaid <hi>Varano</hi>) as it is true, ſo will it reſolue all difficulties, and not being ſiniſterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, will not be altogether diſcrepant from your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>
            <p>Theſe two concluſions therefore are inferred: the firſt is, that vertue is properly ſhee, that bringeth forth Nobilitie, The ſecond, that Nobilitie cannot bee nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor brought to her perfection, without riches. The firſt concluſion is manifeſt of it ſelfe, the ſecond is prooued by this reaſon: for as the practiſe of mechanicall and vile trade, is proper to him ignoble, ſo belongeth it to him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to vſe freely liberall artes; and therefore the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher affirmeth, that the life of mechanicall artificers is baſe, degenerating from vertue, and vnworthy a ciuill man: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that to acquire vertue, quiet, and leaſure is requiſit: where vpon it may bee noted againſt the Stoicke, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility taketh not his beginning, ſo much from abandoning of vice, as from giuing ouer baſe practiſes, and mechanicall artes, and applying ones ſelfe to thoſe liberall. And becauſe theſe cannot be freely exerciſed without riches, therefore are Riches neceſſarie for the preſeruation of Nobilitie: in that one oppreſſed with pouertie, cannot haue a quiet peaceable life, hee beeing inforced to gaine his liuing by manuall aite: And therefore the Philoſopher in his Politickes, if I remember well, ſaieth; Nobilitie conſiſteth of auncient richeſſe and vertue: minding to inferre, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16643:105"/>though Nobility hath vertue for foundation, yet can it not be nouriſhed nor continued without riches; the which, the greater antiquitie they be of in a familie, the more ſpeciall token giue they of Nobility and vertue, ſeeing ancient ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches can, not be preſerued without ancient vertue: that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is by riches preſerued, and through want thereof loſt, experience and reaſon manifeſteth it: for principalities and riches once loſt, wee ſee moſt noble families come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and looſe their Nobilitie, thoſe Noble being conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through want, to applie themſelues to baſe courſes, and mechanicall arts: wherein, as the body is contaminate, ſo is Nobilitie ſtained. Lette vs then auerre, conformable to your iudgement, that the poore man through ſingular vertue, may bee foundation of Nobilitie: but then wee muſt adde alſo, that it cannot be nouriſhed and reduced to due &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ſtature, nor in a family be preſerued without ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: whereupon as <hi>Fabritius, Menenius, Agrippa, Attilius Regulus, Cneius Scipio, Phocyon, Lyſander, Epaminondas,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtides</hi> the iuſt, being poore, were for their notable vertue, a ſufficient beginning of Nobility: ſo by defect of wealth, it was quickly annihilate in their diſcendants. And if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring (ſaid <hi>Patritio</hi>) were as vertuous as the firſt founder, might not nobilitie be nouriſhed, and take propagation without riches? And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> Noble race would either bee verie rare, or none at all, if ſegnealate and heroycall vertue, were as neceſſary for the nouriſhment, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Nobility, this beeing a thing ſo admirable and rare to bee found. Therefore I ſay, that as by excellent and ſingular vertue ſhee is generate, ſo is ſhee foſtred and maintained by riches and indifferent vertue. Declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs I beſeech you (replied <hi>Patritio</hi>) before wee proceede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, what is ſegnealate and excellent vertue, &amp; what vertue indifferent: for I did not thinke that in vertue there could haue beene any defect, mediocritie, or exceſſe, the Philoſopher hauing tolde mee, that there can neuer be too rertuous a man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:16643:105"/>I am ſure, ſignior <hi>Patritio,</hi> anſwered <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano,</hi> you faine ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to the end that others may the better vnderſtand, as he that no leſſe deſireth to aſsiſt others, than helpe himſelfe; I therefore, to ſatisfie your good intention, wil faine alſo to inſtruct you, to the end others may learne: and therefore I ſay, that if we conſider vertue in her ſelfe, ſhee being a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocritie equally diſtant, betwixt twoo extreames, cannot participate of more or leſſe: but if wee reſpect the ſubiect into which vertue is receiued, ſhee ſhal not be in all points equall: For, as in men, complexions, exerciſes, and ſtudies be diuers: ſo will ſome particular vertue, in one, bee more ſplendant than in another: as for example: in a man of war, he being alwayes conuerſant about things terrible, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of fortitude ſhall be more noted, than in a ciuill man, who applieth himſelfe to the gouernement of the common wealth: For in him the vertue of iuſtice wil bee more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, as in the Philoſopher the vertue of temperance. The exceſſe then of vertue, according to the Philoſopher, is after this maner expreſſed: the which exceſſe is of ſuch a nature, as it cannot paſſe into vice, but rather is properly that which maketh a man magnanimous; and it is called vertue Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, as that which participateth both of humanitie and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: and this is either excellencie in profeſsion of armes, accompanied with morall vertues, or great wiſedome, and ciuill vnderſtanding: inſomuch as from theſe two vertues, cities receyue cheefeſt good and benefite. But becauſe theſe excellencies are not graunted to euery one, neyrher is it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally giuen to all men, to be apt to warfare, or enclined to the ſtudy of good letters, I will count him poſſeſſed with indifferent vertue, in whom ſhall appeare gentle cuſtoms, that ſhall be continent, modeſt, not enuious, no euill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, a keeper of promiſe, a friend to right and equitie: faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in preſeruing things committed vnto him, as wel mony, as ſecrets, a louer of trueth, that through deprauation of mind conſents to no brutiſh action, nor through temerity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacteth no vndecent thing: and that aboue all the reſt, ſhall
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16643:106"/>be religious and liberall. And to conclude, an enemie to al vice, and a friend to vertue: when it is therefore ſayde, that they alſo ſhall be noble, whoſe predeceſſors through riches haue beene renowmed, indifferent vertue is not excluded: for then the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would be moſt falſe, but rather that vertue heroycall, the which of it ſelfe without riches is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable: whereas the Philoſopher in his Rhetorike hath numbred the offpring of <hi>Socrates</hi> amongſt thoſe noble, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, which yet may be doubted, that <hi>Socrates,</hi> and thoſe that tame of him were poore, we muſt obſerue, that hee in his Rhetorike entreatiug of things, which in the eie of the people be apparant, he doth not always philoſophically, but ſometimes, after a centaine manner, ſpeaketh and diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth particularly, tying and accommodating himſelfe, rather to vulgar opinion, than pune veritie: and there is no doubt, but if thatq excuſed him not, hee ſhould many wayes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelfe: for there could not alſo be any antiquitie of blood, nor of ſpring of <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Aristotles</hi> time. Seeing that, as <hi>Ammonius</hi> affirmeth in the life of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he at 17. yeres of age, went to heare <hi>Socrates,</hi> and was his diſciple for three yeres. Conſidering for my ſake (ſaid <hi>Patritio</hi>) you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that vertue is the mother, I am content, in fauor of you, that riches may be the tutreſſe of nobilitie: which ought to nouriſh and reduce her to perfection. Then ſignior <hi>Alfonſo Turcho,</hi> deſirous to heare further of the matter: Me thinkes ſaid he, ſignior <hi>Hercole,</hi> your opinion is very conformable to trueth, which is, that Nobilitie taketh originall, rather from giuing ouer mechanicall artes, and baſe practiſes, than from abandoning vice: the philoſopher confirming the ſame, where he ſaith, that he which is employed in baſe practiſes, cannot exerciſe vertue: and there is no doubt, but all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths, as well ancient, as moderne, diſtinguiſh by this Caracter, the noble from the vulgar ſort: And the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher would, not only, that the plebeian ſhould be free from vice, but further allotteth vnto him a certain portion of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſaying, in the mechanicall man ſo much vertue ſufficeth,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16643:106"/>as wherwith he may iuſtly practiſe his trade and profeſsion; but for all this, I am doubtfull, for if Nobilitie ſhould haue her originall from leauing trades mechanicall, and not from abandoning of vice, this inconuenience would follow: For the profeſſor of mechanical arts, being without vice, ſhould be ignoble, and he practiſing liberall Artes, though vitious, muſt come to be noble, and ſo conſequently, any wicked man, applying himſelfe to liberall artes, might be author of Nobilitie.</p>
            <p>This your doubt ariſeth (aunſwered <hi>Varano</hi>) from not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing well vnderſtoode, all the circumſtances, from which Nobilitie is deriued, although I deſcribed them vnto you: becauſe it is neceſſary, that the firſt founder of Nobilitie, giue not ouer, only arts mechanicall, and apply himſelfe to the ſtudie of artes liberall, but further, that hee vertuouſly, and with decencie practiſe them; which doing, he can neuer be vitious. You wil then inferre, added <hi>Turcho,</hi> that he who wil be truly noble, or beginning of nobilitie, ought, not only to abandon mechanicall profeſsions, but alſo to flie vice. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen very ſo, ſaide <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano.</hi> And what vnderſtand you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Turcho,</hi> by thoſe words, to exerciſe liberall Arts ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly? And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> Theſe wordes declare, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to one noble, to practiſe liberall Arts without vice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is bound to vſe them, not for auarice, or ambition, as many doe, but onely for honeſtie. And what vnderſtand you by liberal arts, ſaid <hi>Turcho?</hi> And <hi>Varano:</hi> By liberal arts, I generally intend al thoſe exerciſes, aſwel of the minde, as body, which are worthy of a vertuous and ciuil man, as are al the Sciences, as wel diuine, as humane, and the arts which vnto ſome Sciences are annexed and ſubalternate, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others, the Arte of Warre, and ſtudie of the Lawes: For the one preſerueth, and the other gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Common-wealth: And therefore al thoſe, who addict themſelues to theſe exerciſes, not to reape thereof benefit and gaine, but in fauour of themſelues, their frinds, and of honeſtie, eyther they are the beginning of nobilitie
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16643:107"/>to their diſcendants, or elſe not degenerating from their predeceſſlors, may bee recounted amongſt thoſe noble. You impoſe too ſeuere a law, added Count <hi>Scipio Socrate,</hi> vppon Nobility, you holding opinion, that they noble, are enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to practiſe liberall arts, without hope of drawing from them any benefit: ſo that Doctorſhippe, which by Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors is ſo priuiledged, ſhould verie ſeldome bee the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of nobilitie, we continually ſeeing, that the multitude of doctours, eſpecially of Lawyers, is alwaies ententiue to gaine. And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> He that hath a generous &amp; noble mind, ſhal eaſily obſerue this law, but to the degenerate and baſe mind, it may wel ſeeme rigorous. Therefore I replie, that thoſe doctors, who ſel words al the day long for gain, yea &amp; for lies alſo, cannot but acidenrally be authors of Nobility, notwithſtanding they ſhould acquire greater wealth, then <hi>Craſſus;</hi> but their inheritors, by imploying this obtained wealth, and exerciſing decently liberall arts, might well lay the foundation of Nobilitie to their progeny. And if a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, reading or inſtructing (ſaid <hi>Socrate</hi>) ſhould receiue ſome publike ſtipend, would it any thing preiudice him in Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? And <hi>Varano:</hi> Publike ſtipend being in anu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of things honourable, &amp; honor of an houeſt man deſired, as an enſigne of vertue, to receiue it inward, eſpecially through her bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, doth not only, not preiudice, but moreouer exalteth to Nobilitie: By the ſame reaſon alſo, a ſtipend which the Prince beſtoweth on thoſe noble, to ſerue him vpon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the warre, or in any other honourable action, doth not a whit blemiſh, but rather maketh nobility the more to ſhine and be reſplendant, in that the ſtipend of a Prince, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth the Common-wealth, is a publike ſtipend, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vertue in him noble, &amp; that hee either hath, or is fitte to perform ſome benefit to the prince or common-wealth. But Count <hi>Hercole Taſſone,</hi> who ſate by him ſaid: I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly vnderſtand, if to practiſe marchandiſe wer any obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Nobility: Ferif that ſhould be true, the Venetian No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſo highly eſteemed of, wold be nothing worth, in that

And I haue, and do know ſome princes, that are giuen to trade of marchandiſe, and yet amongſt others noble, thoſe princes are moſt noble: and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> Although the Philoſopher affirmeth, that the life of marchants is baſe, and contrary to vertue, as alſo the Thebanes made a law, that none might be capable of honors in the commonwealth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they had giuen ouer trade, for the ſpace of ten yeares before: notwithſtanding, I make this diſtinction: For mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe may be practiſed two manner of waies, the one, by cauſing to be brought out of farre countries, thoſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which are not in their own, to their owne gaine, and for benefit alſo of the common-wealth, the other, by not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting publike benefit, but onely to enrich himſelfe, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp the commodity of his owne country, whereof there is aboundance, expecting occaſion to ſell them againe at a greater price, and this being grounded Vpon auarice, and a ſordide gaine, as it is from vertue farre remote, ſo dooth not that other blemiſh at al Nobility, eſpecially, if it be practiſed with Decorum. And howe may it be practiſed with Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum (added <hi>Taſſone?</hi>) He noble in vſing trade, ſhall obſerus Decorum (ſayd <hi>Varano</hi>) if for all this he giue not ouer liberal artes, but ſhall vſe the other by the hand of his agents, &amp; not ſell his commoditie by retale, ſetting forth ſhoppes with it, but vtter it in groſle, and for a reaſonable price, hauing euer his eie no leſſe to publike benefit, then vnto priuate gaine: with this Decorum the Venetian Nobilitie practiſe it: For they noble, not forſaking profeſsion and arts liberall, as alſo not neglecting affaires, and publike magiſtracies, procure with their ſhips, commodities to be tranſported out of other countries, for which cauſe they maintain their factors, ſelling altogither in groſſe, helping by this meanes, not onely their country, but alſo many other neighbor prouinces, &amp; therfore in this maner preſeruing and increaſing wealth, they do no

Thoſe Signiors Vndoubtedlie are noble (added <hi>Taſſone</hi>) for beſides their being moſt opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent both in publike &amp; priuate, &amp; lords of ſo miraculous &amp; great a city, as is <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp; moſt mighty alſo by land &amp; ſea, they may further be eſteemed the only nobles of <hi>Italy,</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in their ancient families hauing neuer bin defaced, the original wherof is reckoned from nine hundred yeares, by the Barbarous nations, the which by their Cities of <hi>Italie</hi> cannot be affirmed, wherin ſome of the nobles vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to come out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> others out of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; many out of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But to returne to our purpoſe, ſeeing he noble may traffick, I wold alſo vnderſtand, if without touch of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, he may heape vp treaſure or no: for of this I doubt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially hauing read, that amongſt the Romanes it was highly commended, neither to deminiſh nor augment a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, that generous people imagining, that it was a hard matter to accumulate gold &amp; treaſure without vice.

The honeſt frugalitie and moderate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the vertuous (ſaid <hi>Taſſone</hi>) is rather to be attributed to thoſe excellent lawes, &amp; good cuſtomes, wherewith that moſt prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t commonwealth is gouerned, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the vertu of particular men: for diet, by the laws is moderated, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous apparrel, as wel in women, as men forbidden: for the magiſtracie of Cenſors, which is a place of great dignitie in the common-wealth, is principally intentiue about this, ſeuerely chaſtiſing thoſe, who contemning the laws, exceed the meane ſet down, in their apparrel, diet, or other ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluities. This law (added <hi>Varano</hi>) is of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that by it principally, the commonwealth flouriſheth, and is maintained: for richeſſe by this meanes, is not onely
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16643:109"/>preſerued (the props of Nobilitie) but alſo pride is abated, all occaſion of enuie taken away, of hatred, diſdaine, and conſequently of all ſeditions: In that thoſe men, equall in Nobilitie, but in riches inferior to others, not being able to tollerate, the pompe and pride of them more opulent, in apparrel, &amp; other exterior apparances, excelled by theſe diſcontented with their owne eſtate, they would eaſily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after innouation of ſtate in the common-wealth: and there is no doubt, but if the prince with lawes bridle not the ſubiects follie, that men in citties ſhall liue ſcarce happyly, ſeeing men by nature, are ſo vaine and ambitious, as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſorte, by apparrell ſtriue to ſeeme noble; as they noble, alſo contend to appeare like princes: &amp; ſetting their whole deſire vppon no other then an exterior apparance, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not to be ſeene beggers in their houſes, ſo that in the market place they may appeare rich. Seeing you haue here made it knowne (ſaide count <hi>Caeſar Taſſone</hi>) in what manner it is lawfull for one noble to trafficke and enrich himſelfe: diſpleaſe it not you alſo to declare, whether a Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh to his Mareſty, may heape vp treaſure: by one reaſon it ſeemeth hee may not, for as the Philoſopher affirmeth, accumulating of treaſure is proper to a Tyrant: honor and glory belonging to a right &amp; good Prince; and conſidering, that a Prince may at his pleaſure, diſpoſe of his ſubiectes and wealth, he maketh a farre better reckning, by laying vppe his treaſure in the purſes of his ſubiects, and friends, then euer gleaning from them, to locke it vp cloſe in his owne treaſurie: in that by there hiding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from himſelfe his ſubiectes mindes, making himſelfe only Lord ouer gold: but contrarie wiſe, laying them vp in their purſes, he becommeth tyrant both of their golde, and mindes: then which minde, there is nothing more difficulte to bee gouerned, as that, which not by force, or violence, but only with beneficence may bee acquired: but further, what need a prince hoard vp treaſure, when by the ſame meanes hee can neuer become poore, how royall and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16643:109"/>ſoeuer hee be, in that at his pleaſure he might fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh himſelfe with his ſubiects wealth. It is not onely lawful (anſwered <hi>Varano</hi>) but alſo is neceſſarie that a Prince ſhould gather riches, ſeeing he repreſenteth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the treaſure of the prince is publike treaſure, wherwith he defendeth the Cittie in time of war, &amp; in time of peace ſupplyeth the peoples wants, &amp; which moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, by them the greatnes &amp; reputation of principalitie is maintained, not being any thing that maketh a Prince more highly eſteemed, then to bee rich of treaſure, mony being as it were the nerues and ſinewes of warre: wherefore aboue al other matters, a Prince ought to be reſpectiue of falling into want of treaſure: for he no ſooner diſcouereth himſelf nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but, though a verie great prince, hee ſodainly groweth into contempt, and eaſily becommeth a pray to his enemies. A good Prince therefore, ought in gathering of wealth, to haue an eye alwayes to honeſtie, contending to increaſe his treaſure, rather by auoyding ſuperfluous &amp; exceſsiue expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then by impoſing new and vnwoonted exactions, to the end he ſhew not a deſire to enlarge his own royalty, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of his ſubiects ſtore, for this ſhuld be no other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a good Prince, to become a tyrant: the true Prince no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe differing from the tyrant (as the Philoſopher tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) but that the prince rather ſeeketh to enrich his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, then himſelf, &amp; a tirant, as he that conſidereth not that a prince is ordained for his ſubiects good, &amp; not the ſubiects in fauor of the prince, not a whit reſpecting the good of his people, performeth all things for profit, &amp; to pleaſe himſelf: and therefore the obiect of a true prince is honeſſie, and of a tyrant, his owne wil and contentment. He then that ſhal ſtore vppe treaſure in ſuch ſort as is conuenient for a true Prince, preſerueth his reputation in peace, and maketh himſelfe ſtrong for war, and by nor oppreſsing the minds of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, hee ſhal euer be a true and lawfull potentate. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of <hi>

And count <hi>Ceſar</hi> replying no further, ſignior <hi>Guilio Ceſar Brancaccio:</hi> I well remember, ſaide he, Signior <hi>Torquato Taſſo</hi> in one of his dialogues, which he intituled <hi>Forno,</hi> intreating of nobility, holdeth this concluſion, that a man of valor, though he be not honeſt, is properly he, that gineth beginning to nobiltie, by acquiring power &amp; riches, leauing them to his progenie: which concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he verifieth by the example of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who though he was not an honeſt man, yet becauſe hee was moſt vaiorous, left his poſteritie great, and mightie: From this concluſion, there ariſe in me two doubts, the one is, whether from one not good, nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may take originall, the other is, whether vice and valor may ſtand together: vppon theſe difficulties, Signior <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> I expect your opinion. And <hi>Hercules:</hi> Before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further, it will be good, that the firſt diſcourſing ſearch out the true ſignification, and from whence theſe termes, a man of valor, bee deriued, the which, neither with the Latines, nor Grecians I neuer finde expreſſed, and I do not beleeue that they can be ſet downe in ſuch manner, and with that grace as they ſound in our language: for my part, I ſhould think that this word valor, were deriued from the vulgar word <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alere,</hi> which wee commonly vſe in thoſe thinges that are ſolde for price: and that ſpeaking properly, it importes as much to ſay, as this thing is of great value, as to ſay, it valueth, or is worth ſo much: or the price of it is ſo tated: and forther, I am of opinion that thoſe things are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolurely of value, which in their kinde (be they artifinall, or naturall) are good, and apt to that end, wherevnto art or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture directeth, &amp; not being ſuch, althogh they may welſerue to ſome ſuch vſe, yet may they not abſolutely bee termed of value; which being true (as it is) ſo cannot he be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man of valor, who is not honeſt, conſidering hee is not apt to that end, wherevnto uature and the author of hir, hath directed him, which is felicitie: &amp; I ſay abſolutely of valor; becauſe it is not to be otherwiſe thought, but that he being expert in ſome arte, or ſcience, may be of indifferent eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16643:110"/>This is conformable to the Philoſopher, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of wiſedome, and wiſe men, he ſaith, that this name properly agreeth with thoſe, that of all humane actions performe euer the beſt: but for all this, thoſe alſo, who in ſome one Arte are excellent, do vſurpe this terme: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon we vſe to ſay, that <hi>Praxiles</hi> and <hi>Phydias</hi> were expert and excellent Grauers. Nowe to our purpoſe: If <hi>Taſſo</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that a man not good, may be called abſolutely of valor, in my iudgement, he is deceiued: but if he intendeth, that valorous may be applied, after the ſame maner, as <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> was ſaid to be wiſe and excellent, which was only in the art of Grauing, he ſpoke well: In like maner, he is deceiued if he beleeue that the man valorous, accompanied with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may of himſelfe bee founder of Nobilitie, and I ſay of himſelfe, in that by accident he is not forbidden, ſuch an one leauing riches &amp; power to his poſterity, by meane of which, they may with honor exerciſe vertue, and liberal Arts. Your opinion, ſaid <hi>Brancaccio,</hi> is conformable to my humour, and grounded vpon preualent reaſons: For if by nobilitie wee ſuppoſe an inclination vnto vertue, in him noble, it beeing likely, that from the better, better ſtill ſprings; if he firſt had beene wicked, both ſuppoſition and propoſition would be falſe: For from one not good, another good ſhould take his originall; but according to my obſeruation, this worde valor, ſeemeth properly to be vſurped in thoſe vſes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to warre; ſo that when we ſay, he is valorous, or of valour, preſently we vnderſtand it in Armes. Arte Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, anſwered <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano,</hi> as it hath euer beene, of all others the moſt noble and honorable, ſo thoſe who make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of bearing armes, notwithſtanding for the moſt parte, they be menquellers, and moſt wicked, vſurpe, not onely the name and title of valorous, but alſo of honeſt men: as though it were all one, to be valiant with armes in hand, and be an honeſt man: but as it is falſe, that one wicked by being valorous may be good, ſo is it as falfe, that he may be termed a man of valor. Signior <hi>Guilio Caeſare</hi> confirmd this ſaying, &amp;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16643:111"/>the Count <hi>Scandiano,</hi> doubted after this maner: You ſignior <hi>Hercules,</hi> amongeſt the principall properties of Nobilitie, haue placed, not onely renowne of aunceſters, but alſo of Country: as though the property of ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; famous bloud, were not ſufficient, notwithſtanding one were borne in a ſmall village, to illuſtrate and make noble a progenie: but if we turne ouer ancient and moderne Recordes, we ſhall finde moſt noble and famous families, to haue taken their originall, in baſe and humble place: and to diſcourſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further, the ſame heauen couereth all things, and heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; the ſelfe ſunne illuminateth; and to man of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures moſt excellent, there is not limited one earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habitation only as to the other, but through diuine fauor the whole worlde, hee being in his life time an inhabiter of the whole earth; and being worthy, after death to be a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of heauen: wherefore good <hi>Diogenes</hi> demaunded of what countrey he was, a citizen of the world, anſwered he: minding to inferre, that not a mans country, but vertue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtreth honor and glorie, and that a man ought to boaſt, not of his country, but only of vertue: the which of it ſelfe is ſufficient, to illuſtrate the obſcureſt countrey whatſoeuer, as <hi>Anacharſis</hi> the Scithian Philoſopher expreſſeth very wel, who to a fooliſh Athenian, that obiected vnto him the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his countrey, anſwered: My baſe country I by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ennoble, and thou thy country noble, obſcureſt by vice: And we reade, that the vertue of <hi>Homer,</hi> mooued emulation amongſt ſeauen of the principall citties of Graecia, each of them vaunting, that hee was borne their originall citizen, doing this for no other cauſe, but to make themſelues fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, with the renowne of this mannes vertue: by which it is manifeſt, that the vertuous man giueth, and receiueth not honour from his countrey: As I beleeue therefore the definition of nobilitie woulde be much more perfect, if it wanted this clauſe: notwithſtanding I expect that you lay open my errour.</p>
            <p>And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> As Nature and GOD haue made
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16643:111"/>manne Lorde of the earth, and cittizen of the worlde, ſo hath he not in the globe of the whole earth, one place more then another, appropriate for his birth, and habitation; in that as experience teacheth, he might liue, and inhabite in all places: notwithſtanding by fortune hee hath his birth more in one, then in another, and the place where hee is borne and nouriſhed, wee call his country, and natiue ſoyle: A man therefore by nature is a cittizen of the world, and by fortune of the land and prouince where he was borne: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it bee denied alſo that citties and places of a land, are greatly different, as alſo I will not heere moue conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of diuerſitie of climates, which (as appereth alſo in vnreaſonable creatures) ordinarily make wonderfull diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in the ſtature and complexion of the body, &amp; affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of minde, as the Philoſopher affirmeth, ſpeaking of the nature of the people of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Greece:</hi> but diuerſity of lawes, manners, and cuſtomes, are ſuch, as what in one cittie ſeemeth vniuſt, and impious, in another is admitted, as honeſt, and iuſt: which being true, wee muſt of necesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie confeſſe, that one borne, and nouriſhed in a cittie built and augmented by men heroycall, grounded by excellent lawes, where prudence, ſapience, and all other liberall artes, are practiſed, is reputed much more vertuous, then another borne and brought vp in a countrie, where barbarous laws, vnciuill cuſtomes, and no other artes be profeſſed and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, but thoſe mechanicall, and baſe: with which reaſon moued, the Philoſopher ſaide, that Barbarians neuer were, nor could bee called, perfectly noble. Country therefore importeth ſo greatly, as without the glory of it, no perfect nobilitie can bee framed; I ſay perfect, becauſe he may alſo bee called noble, who is deſcended of ancient and vertuous parentage, although in meane and humble place. You haue ſo well reſolued my doubt (ſaide <hi>Scandiano</hi>) as that I cannot but replie, and confeſſe that honor of country, is neceſſarie to perfect nobilitie. Signior <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano,</hi> muſt needs ſatisfie me alſo (ſaide <hi>Guirino</hi>) for it will not ſinke into my head, that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16643:112"/>Nobilitie is an extern all good, or of fortune, eſpecially hee hauing aſſirmed, that nobility is euer ioyned with vertue; the which vertue, as it is neither of Fortune, nor by Fortune, the Philoſopher ſo teaching, ſo can it not be an eternall good: For vertue being an habite, and perfection of our minde, it cannot but be numbred amongſt thoſe goods, which in vs be intrinſecate: looſe therefore my doubt, and this your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradiction. And <hi>Varano:</hi> Signior <hi>Guirino</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an excellent probleme, whether nobility bee in the number of thoſe goods internall, or that it be externall, and of Fortune: and to ſhew the dexterity of his ſingular wit, as though he conceiued not the truth, hee concludeth by our own poſition, that nobility is not a good externall, nor of Fortune, we hauing affirmed that in it vertue, as alſo other poynts precious and honourable were contained. To which we eaſily make anſwere, if wee ſhal but conſider what before I haue ſaid, for it is true, that nobility may be placed amongſt thoſe goods of Fortune, as that which happneth beyond the intention of Nature, and is by the Philoſopher numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe goods which are not in our ſelues: for although it haue originall from vertue, yet dependeth it not of the onely vertue of him that poſſeſſeth it, but rather of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his many predeceſſors, which is truely that, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth glorie in him noble, being termed Nobility. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon as the vertue of the moſt guttering ſunne-beames, is of force to make things obſcure viſible, ſo the vertue of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcendants of a moſt bright beame, may illuſtrate an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure linage, how haſe or vile ſoeuer; &amp; as the ſunne-beames are not in the thing illumined, as in proper obiect, ſo the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of predeceſſors is not in him noble, as in his particular ſubiect, but hee, together with others of the ſame bloud, dof enioy the reſplendant brightneſſe of their predeceſſors. Is Nobilitie (replied <hi>Guirino</hi>) bee a vertue of ſtocke or kinde, a the Philoſopher ſayth, &amp; dependeth on antiquitie of bloud, wee receiuing bloud from the bodies of our predeceſſors, I cannot ſee howe it ſhould rather bee a gift of Nature, then
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16643:112"/>Fortune, beeing to be recounted rather among thoſe goods within our ſelues, then amongſt other externall. And <hi>Vara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no:</hi> A man noble is begotten, by Nature, ſeed, &amp; Fortune: for Fortune is no other, but a concourſe of diuers cauſes, whereof the moſt neare, is a cauſe vndetermined: Man, as man, is deriued from nature and ſeede: but in reſpect of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, from Fortune for it is a thing contingent, and no wayes knowne vnto Nature, that a man ſhoulde bee borne, whoſe predeceſſors haue beene renowned and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Tell me in earneſt (added <hi>Guirino</hi>) is it not the intention of nature to make man, as all other things, in ſuch perfection, as that hee may eaſily attaine his proper ende. This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (ſayde <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano</hi>) is neceſſary and alwayes true, that nature guideth by infallible prouidence, maketh euer the beſt of all things, if ſhee bee not hindered. And <hi>Guirino:</hi> If therefore in him noble, there is greater perfection then in all other conditions, and that Nature alwayes intendeth that perfect, me thinkes, it neceſſarily followeth, that hee ſhould bee borne Noble, not by Fortune, but by intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature, and conſequently, that Nobilitie is the giſt of Narure, and not of Fortune.</p>
            <p>You may perceiue Signior <hi>Guirino</hi> (ſayde <hi>Varano</hi>) that this your concluſion is not neceſſarie: for all propoſitions of a ſyllogiſme, are not euer true and neceſſary: for though in him Noble, greater perfection is ſuppoſed then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet many times the contrarie falleth out, as euerie day experience plainely teacheth, and therefore I deſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t with <hi>Mutius</hi> his definition, that is, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie is not the perfection of euery thing in his kind, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an inward ſuppoſition of vertue, as hath bin ſaid, which dependeth on the glory and fame of his predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guirino</hi> replied no further: And Count <hi>Hanib all Turcho:</hi> You, Signior <hi>Hercole,</hi> if I carry wel in mind, ſaid: that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be noble, who is not borne legitimate, if that were true, in would follow, that the ſon of a noble father &amp; mother, might
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16643:113"/>be ignoble, this ſeeming inconuenient: for if it be true, that Nobilitie, as the Philoſopher affirmeth, is a vertue of kinde, it hath originall from ſeed, and not from marriage: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in reſpect of nature, is a thing accidentall, neither can it augment or diminiſh perfection in ſeed; and to ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon naturall example, as to generate a couragious horſe, it ſufficeth to put together a noble Stallion, and a goodly Mare: ſo to make one noble, without other marriage, the vnion of a noble man, and woman, ſhall be ſufficient. And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> Although matrimonie is not eſſentiall, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to generation, and that the vnion of male and female ſufficeth, yet is it neceſſary, for the framing of one perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noble: conſidering that one perfectly noble is he, that hath had all his predeceſſors renouned, and famous, as alſo with vice immaculate: In that therfore it cannot be denied, but the baſtard hath had his father and mother, contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, with the vice of intemperance, as thoſe who came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contrarie to honeſtie, and repugnant to that, the lawes both diuine, and humane command, although many of his predeceſſors were noble, yet muſt he needs confeſſe, that himſelfe is not perfectly noble: but that he wanteth an ounce of arriuing to perfect nobilitie: and I ſay perfect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, becauſe it is not denied, but that baſtards alſo may haue ſome part in nobilitie, and in vertue bee like to their grandfathers, and great grandfathers.</p>
            <p>And if baſtards were legitimate (added Count <hi>Haniball</hi>) ſhould they not ſupplie the ounce they want, and become perfectly noble? Wiſe Lawgiuers (ſayd <hi>Varano</hi>) to auoyde the vice of intemperance, hauing depriued baſtards, as well from ſucceſsion of their fathers goods, as of any other good of fortune, beeing thoſe, who contrary to the diſpoſition of the lawes and commandements of God, were begotten, it was prouided to mitigate ſeuerity of lawe, that by cheefe Princes, who bee the lawes ſuperiours, they might by priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge bee admitted to ſucceſsion. So that legitimation may make them capable of riches, but not of perfect nobilitie
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16643:113"/>I am ſatisfied, ſaide Count <hi>Haniball:</hi> And Count <hi>Hercules Beuelacqua:</hi> I haue ſeene, ſaid he, while I was in the French Court, priuileges of nobilitie giuen by that king, to perſons ignoble, yet deſeruing well of the crowne of France; as alſo, other men moſt noble, to be deptiued of nobilitie, for their contrary demerites, how which ſhould bee done, I cannot ſee, if nobilitie were reſtrained to thoſe families, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelues deſcended of ancient blood: declare vnto vs therfore, if Princes may giue, or take away from another nobilitie. And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> It is a concluſion approoued by Doctors of the law, that Princes by their authoritie, may not onely giue nobilitie by writing, and priuileges, but may alſo ſecretly giue vnto another thoſe degrees, which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to men noble, by inueſting him with ſome noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feofment, as alſo that it is in their power, to depriue nobles of their degrees of nobilitie. And <hi>Bartolo,</hi> a principall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, writeth: that if a man ſhould liue a thouſand yeares re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with chiefe vertue, yet could he neuer be noble, while by the Prince, ſome dignitie or nobilitie, were beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on him, by which he might be diſtinguiſhed, from the common people: Notwithſtanding, I am of opinion, that this Doctor, together with others, haue greatly etred: &amp; in no other reſpect, but that ſpeaking and diſcuſsing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, they haue neuer defined it, but confounded it with titles, magiſtracies, dignities, and other preemenencies; all which bee partes of honour, and rewardes of thoſe actions, which depend on the vertue, of one alone: And I cannot but wonder at <hi>Mutius,</hi> a man certainly both learned, and iudiciall: who, after hauing confounded diuers kindes of nobilitie, mooueth this queſtion, who is more noble, hee that is deſcended of ancieut bloud, or another enobled, by his Prince? and he anſwereth it by theſe formall wordes: If the Prince giue nobilitie to another for true teſtimonial of vertue, he ſhall be moſt noble: but if it be placed throgh humor, or appetite, he borne of ancient bloud, ſhal be more honorable: we muſt therfore affirme according to <hi>Mutius,</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:16643:114"/>that to bee noble and worthy of honor, is the ſelfeſame, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt falſe: for vertuous actions, and not nobilitie, is woorthie of honour: and if nobilitie bee honoured, it is not in reſpect of it ſelfe, but as it is preſumed, that ſhee is with vertue conioyned: But if to bee noble, is a thing diuers from beeing woorthy of honour, who ſeeth not, that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in his demaunde, hath begunne (as in prouerbe wee ſay) a gallon potte, and turning the wheele, like an vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full potter, hath finiſhed a cruſe: But leauing <hi>Mutius,</hi> with all the other Doctours of the lawe, in their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Chaos,</hi> I affirme that a Prince, how great ſoeuer, cannot giue nor take away nobility, if it be ſuch as either we haue, or ought to be defined.</p>
            <p>A Prince may well giue titles, magiſtracie, enfeof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, place, dignity, and other ſuch like moſt ſpeciall honours, but hee can neuer effect, that one borne of the vulgar ſort, ſhould be diſcended from illuſtrous familie, nor that he noble, by the renowne of his predeceſſors, ſhould be borne of baſe and ignoble parents, although he diſhonoured him neuer ſo much. In your foundations (added Count <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole</hi>) you diſcuſſe, as though yours were the true definition of Nobilitie, which neither <hi>Mutius,</hi> nor the other doctors by you named, would euer grant you, for they vnderſtande this terme nobilitie, much more amply, then doth that Greeke word <hi>Euguenia</hi> ſound: If they ſhould not beleeue mee (ſayde <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano</hi>) yet would they giue credite to authoritie of their Emperours, ſeeing <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, who beſide his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had the name to be greatly learned, demanded what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was: made anſwer, ancient riches, and excellent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes: as alſo <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> the moſt wiſe Emperour, whom a man of the vulgar ſort, by him verie well eſteemed, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that he would create him noble, made this anſwere, I may make you rich, and grant you all manner of immunitie, but noble I can no wayes precure you to be. Leauing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and comming to reaſon, either nobilitie is in the world from other things diſtant, or elſe with others the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16643:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſelfe ſame, as with vertue, riches, prayſe, honour, and with other goods internall, or external. If it be the ſelfeſame with others, then is the diſtinct diſcuſsion thereof ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: If it bee from them ſeperate and apart, as particular treatie is neceſſrrie, ſo is it as behoouefull to finde out deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and eſſentially differences, by which the nature there of may bee knowne, to bee from other thinges diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>The definition being giuen, conformable to the doctrine of the Philoſopher, is ſuch, as that it ſheweth this excellence which wee terme Nobilitie, to bee of different nature from all other goods and properties, therefore it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and good. But the definition of <hi>Mutius</hi> and other Doctors, can neither be blamed, nor commended, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hauing defined, or giuen any ſigne thereof, whereby wee might diſtinguiſh it from vertue, prayſe, and honour, but haue ſo obſcured it, with the colours of other things, as that there is no ſight ſo quicke, which is able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it. Me thinkes (ſayd Count <hi>Hercole</hi>) that from <hi>Mutius,</hi> which I haue alſo ſeene, the definition of Nobilitie may verie well bee drawne: for hee affirming that Noble ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth one woorthie to be knowne, it may be ſayde, that Nobilitie is a good, which maketh another man worthie to be knowne.</p>
            <p>See you not (anſwered <hi>Varano</hi>) that by this definition, vertue, riches, hnor, and other goods, which make another man woorthie to bee knowne, are not a whit diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from Nobilitie, which the Philoſopher ſheweth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That there be three ſortes of Cittizens in a Common-wealth, worthy to be knowne, thoſe be the rich, noble, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and there is no doubt, but one may be rich, popular, and vertuous, and yet not well borne: and for all this, hee ſhall be worthie to be known. But to return to our purpoſe, they greatly abuſe themſelues, who baſelie borne, growe proude of receiued Nobilitie, as though the authority of the prince had made them regenerate &amp; borne anew. But what
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16643:115"/>ſay you of the Nobilitie, added count <hi>Hercole,</hi> which the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory of <hi>Venice</hi> vſually giues to them, that haue performed any ſingular benefit to their common-wealth? is not that tru Nobilitie? as they did to <hi>Giacomo Cauallo,</hi> of <hi>

And by the reaſons aboue, by vs alleadged, thoſe firſt who of common people were made noble, were truelie honoured: but yet not ennobled with true and perfect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: whereupon they were rather a beginning of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to their poſteritie, then truly noble: and to conclude, Princes may by their authority, giue beginning of Nobility to a familie, as likewiſe of diſgrace and ignobilitie, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, when through deſert of vertue they honor good men, and for vice, reproach thoſe wicked. Your concluſion (ſaid count <hi>Hercules</hi>) is ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to truth, as I am out of al doubt. I haue good cauſe to doubt alſo (ſaid Count <hi>Guido Calcag.</hi>) neither wil it euer ſinke into my head, that nobility (as <hi>Varano</hi> hath ſet down) is in the kind of good things, being rather to be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt thoſe euil, which hinder felicity: in that nobility in him noble, doth no leſſe poyſon and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his ſweeteſt contentments, then an other may be, who is reiected. Behold a fine paradox (ſaid <hi>Varano.</hi>) That is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox (replied <hi>Calcgnini</hi>) which is not with ſound reaſon acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16643:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>for how can that be a good, which depriueth of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and bindeth with hard knots of ſeruitude? and who ſeeth not that nobilitie is ſuch, ſeeing he noble, can neither do nor ſay any thing without conſent of nobilitie? he being continually enioyned, to his great diſcontentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to ſpeake, walke, ſtand ſtill, bee apparrelled, vſe wealth, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all his operations not as he would, but in ſuch ſorte as his nobility vrgeth him, with hauing an eie euer to decorum, and not to obſcure the glory of his predeceſſors: the which cannot by ignobilitie be affirmed, in that full of moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant libertie, it giueth licence to the ignoble to liue not only after his own minde, but liſcentiouſly to ceaſe vpon al thoſe contentments, which beaſt pleaſe him, without hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to time, place, or the dignitie of his predeceſſors. To this truth, theſe illuſtrous Princes, moſt noble Ladies, and honorable Knights, will readyly giue teſtimony, who neuer more ſweetly taſt their delights, then when diſpoyling them ſelues of that proſopopeia which this beaſt of nobilitie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth about with her, they are apparrelled with that liberty, which to pleaſing and iocund ignobilitie is euer annexed: From hence it proceedeth, that to vs gentlemen in Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uale time, masking is ſo acceptable, in that at our owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, wee may transforme our ſelues, ſometimes into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a porter, other whiles, of a country man, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into any other perſon more baſe and vile, taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible pleaſure, in immitating their ſpeach and gate, and practiſing their mechanical and licentious cuſtomes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times freeing our ſelues from the inſolencie of ſeruants and boys, which continually run gaping at our tailes, we proue how ſweete it is to go alone, nowe running, then leaping, ſometimes skipping, by and by laughing: as alſo that wee may enter into any place, without being noted, &amp; execute any knaueries. Surely if we well conſider, we ſhall finde, that this glorie which is termed nobilitie, is no other but a light, which maketh the defects of men noble to euery mannes eye apparant. How many may wee ſay, haue bin, &amp; are the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16643:116"/>men of baſe condition, who haue run a life no leſſe brutiſh and diſſolute, then <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> Lidiane, <hi>Philopater</hi> Acgip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> and <hi>Comodus</hi> romaine Emperours, and yet hauing beene of baſe qualitie, by the eye of the world, they haue not beene diſcouered: whereas on the contrary, of the intemperate, and vitious life of thoſe in noble eſtate, bookes and whole volumes be repleniſhed. But what ſaye you of nobility, ſhe being found (as many times it happeneth) coupled with pouertie? what burthen is more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
            <p>The poore gentleman, not content with that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſuſtentation of humane life, ſuperfluous things wanting, where with nobilitie is puffed vppe in pride, hee yerneth inwardly, and grieuing a thouſand times a day, at his noble birth (as he that is aſhamed, to apply himſelfe to baſe courſe of life) languiſheth in great miſerie: whereas contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe the poore mechanicall man, accuſtomed to labour, &amp; an homely life, no whit carefull for things ſuperfluous, by arte or mechanicall induſtry, preparing thoſe onely, which are ſufficient for humane liuing, leadeth a pleaſant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented life: many other reaſons might be produced, to ſhew, that nobilitie, is rather in the kinde of thinges wicked, then good, which not to appeare a Rhethoritian, I will paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: being well aſſured, that there is not any of theſe moſt noble gentlemen, which to themſelues are not priuie, of the truth of this my concluſion, and that repent not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a thouſand times the day, to haue beene noble borne. It befitteth not (ſigniour <hi>Counte</hi>) anſwered <hi>Varano,</hi> your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde, nor theſe moſt gentle creatures, which here giue care round about vs, to enter into ſo ſiniſter opinion: For Nobilitie is not only, not to be recounted amongſt things wicked, but is a moſt pretious good, by al qualities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, honored and eſteemed, &amp; ſo far off is it from depriuing of libertie, that rather it reacheth a helping hand to deliuer from ſeruitude, there being no greater ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude then vice, as before I haue ſaide, and the Diuines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16643:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>Nobilitie as a moſt cleare ſeeming glaſſe reflecting continually on the eies of him noble, the glorie of his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors valor inuiteth to illuſtrate his mind with vertue, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them, as alſo to ſhun vice. Wherupon <hi>Q. Fabius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> were wont to ſay, that beholding the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their predeceſſors, they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their mind wonderfully inflamed vnto vertue. I confeſſe ſignior Conte, that Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is a cleere lampe, which cauſeth wicked actions, no leſſe than good to appeare, and in this reſpect, is principally wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be placed in the kinde of things good, for ſhee ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and enflameth vnto vertue, as wel with feare of infamy, as with hope of commendation, wherefore this glorie of Nobility not diſcouering it ſelfe, in the operations of them ignoble, they want this pricke of feare and reproach, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke they themſelues bound to proceed further then that their predeceſſors haue performed: and to men noble it ſeemeth great opproby, not to attayne at leaſt to the boundes, ſet downe vnto them by their firſt founders, and therefore in a manner it alwayes falleth out, that in armes, and vertuous actions, the moſt ſingular and excellent men, be of nobility: For Nature hath inſerted a certaine ſecret vertue, in the ſeede of all things, which giueth them force and property, to be like the beginning, from whence they are deriued: The which is manifeſted, by that wee euerie day ſee in men, who are borne of ſhape and proportion, not onely like to their fathers, but alſo reſembling many times, their grandfathers and great grandfathers.</p>
            <p>The like is perceiued alſo in the race of horſes, bullocks, and other creatures, as further euen in trees, that the boughes and braunches doe alwayes in a manuer reſemble the ſtocke and trunke of the tree: And if at any time they degenerate, it proceedeth from the Husbandmans negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The like whereof happeneth to menne, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne, if with good education they bee manured, are alwayes in vertue like thoſe from whome they do proceede, and oftentimes better too. But if they want good pruners,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16643:117"/>and thoſe that of them ſhould haue a care, they become wild and ſauage, neuer bringing forth good fruit: I grant alſo, that nobilitie in the end ſinketh vnder that ponderous weight of pouerty; notwithſtanding, if he noble, together with riches, hath not wholy loſt his generoſitie of minde, there can not want meanes, and honorable courſes for his raiſing vp, three of which, in my opinion, are of great moment; one is, by conſecrating himſelfe to God, and euen as he by fortune is abandoned, ſo with heroycall vertue, to ſhew himſelfe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of the world and fortune: another is, by dedicating himſelfe to the honorable ſeruice of princes: the third is, by practiſing the moſt noble profeſſion Military. And there is no doubt, but that he noble, hath euer a ſpecial aduantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him ignoble, although in vertue they be equall. For, if there ſhould be two men, who had not by good or bad acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, giuen any former trial of themſelues, preſently as it is knowne that the one is nobly borne, and the other not, with euery one he ignoble ſhal be leſſe eſteemed, than the other, noble; and it is neceſſary, that one ignoble, by many ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and in long time, imprint in the minde of men, a good opinion of himſelfe, which the other in a moment, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by being a Gentleman, hath acquired. Al the ſtanders by, confirmed this opinion of Signior <hi>Hercole.</hi> And Count <hi>Palla Strozzi,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Calcagnino</hi> replied no further, I would willingly vnderſtand, ſaid he, from whence this word Gentleman hath had his originall; as alſo if it be alone, to be noble, and to be a genileman: in that by theſe laſt words you vttered, wherein you confound theſe termes, it ſeen eth they are the ſelfe ſame things. Notwithſtanding I ſee many, who though of meane qualitie, yet being but well apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they profeſſe gentilitie; and euer they confirme their ſpeeches, by ſwearing by the faith of a Gentleman, this making mee doubtful, and ſometimes abſolutely to beleeue, that to call a Gentleman dooth not properly ſignifie noble, but rather, and honeſt man, and of gentle cuſtomes. And <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauo:</hi> Touching your firſt demand, I am of opinion, that this
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16643:117"/>word Gentle was deriued from the Latine, as alſo the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of thoſe termes, which in our vulgar tong wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vſe: For gentle, among the Latins, ſignifieth as much as, of the ſelfeſame familie; and in like maner, they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led gentle, who had the ſelfeſame name, as we reade in <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> who ſpeaking of <hi>Tullius Hoſtilius,</hi> calleth him gentle, and writeth in his Topickes, that they be gentle, who amongſt themſelues are of one name, and haue their originall from free men, whoſe predeceſſors haue neuer indured ſeruitude. Whereuppon wee may gather, that this woorde gentle, agreeth with no other, but with perſons of noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: And therefore I iudge, that this worde, which in olde time ſignified thus much, that this man was noble, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him of ſuch a familie, and theſe men were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with thoſe of another familie, enlarging now ſomewhat his ſignification, generally noteth vnto vs, that one noble is ſomwhat more, and as amongſt them they were called gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, who deſcended of noble familie, ſo now thoſe noble are called Gentlemen: ſo that wee may conclude, the name of gentleman to be proper to him noble, and that to one igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it can no wayes be applied. To the ſecond demand, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>Dant, Petrarch,</hi> and <hi>Boccace,</hi> haue indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed theſe two terms, Noble and Gentle: yet do I make ſome difference betwixt them, and holde opinion, that the name of gentleman hath a farre more reſtrained ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than this word, noble, and that a gentleman is he, who by the Philoſopher is called <hi>Geneos,</hi> as much as to ſay, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in whom appeares, not only the vertue of kinde, but alſo that of his proper ſelfe: for though as I ſaide, the name gentle is proper to him noble, yet without vertue, he ſhal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be an vnworthy poſſeſſor thereof: and therefore I thus conclude, that the man noble without vertue, and he vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous without nobilitie, can neuer properly be termed a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. Then, as your concluſion ſtandeth with reaſon (ſaid <hi>Strozza</hi>) ſo doe I coniecture, that the number of true Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen is very ſmall, whereas on the contrary the multitude
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16643:118"/>of them is infinite, who vſurpe this title: (being not onely men noble vitious, and the ignoble vertuous, but alſo, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer by meane of wealth can liue idlely, although hee bee moſt ignoble and vitious, profeſſeth himſelfe a gentleman, ſo that if any man ſhould obiect vnto him, Thou arte not a Gentleman, preſently, as if hee had receiued ſome notable iniurie, he would make anſwer with the lye: neither would he refuſe combate vpon this quarel, as being perſwaded, that hee fought in a iuſt cauſe. Your opinion, ſayd <hi>Varano,</hi> is conformable to that the Philoſopher ſayeth, which is, that all men, in wordes, vſurpe vertue, and nobilitie, but of ſuch as be truely noble and good, there is not twentie, in any one place, to be found. This demaund of Count <hi>Palla,</hi> pleaſed al the knights and gentlemen very well: and the anſwere, thereunto, of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano,</hi> was highly commended. When <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualiere Gualing:</hi> You hitherto Signior <hi>Hercules,</hi> haue ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and particularly diſcourſed of nobilitie, as from this day forward we may thinke that there remaineth not any thing further, which vpon this argument can bee produced: yet for al this ſhall I not bee fully ſatisfied, if you ſet not downe, ſome diſtinct inſormation of the degrees of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for that is no true nor ſufficient cauſe, of ones beeing more noble than another, in that the antiquitie and number of his predeceſſors is the greater, as in the beginning it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth you would haue inferred: for being ſo, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that a priuate gentleman, whoſe bloud were more aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, than that of a King, or Duke, ſhould then either king or duke be more noble: the which as an inconuenience to ſome, wold neuer be yeelded you. I deſire you therfore tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this point to runne ouer the degrees of nobilitie <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano</hi> made anſwer, It appeareth to be a ſubiect proper vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ciuilians, for a parte of iuſtice, being conuerſant in in diſtributing puniſhments, rewards, and honours, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the Ciuilians vnderſtand diſtinctly, and diſcuſſe of degrees of nobilitie, to the end that with geometrical and equall proportion, they may conferre their dignities, titles,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16643:118"/>and preeminences, whereof Nobilitie ſeemeth principally worthie. Notwithſtanding, to giue you ſatisfaction, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vppon my foundations: I diuide nobility into fiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or orders. The firſt aſcending, is them noble, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken original of riches &amp; indifferent vertue, neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed nor diminiſhed, are called priuate Gentlemen. The ſecond is, of thoſe who are honored further with noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feofments, as alſo with iuriſdiction and title of Counts. The third haue equall iuriſdiction, with title ſomewhat more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and are called Marqueſſes. The fourth is the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Dukes: the fift and higheſt is that of Kings. Theſe degrees, haue amongſt themſelues like proportion of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as in them of vertue there is ſuppoſed. Seeing honours &amp; prerogatiues, are imparted to nobilitie correſpondent to the vertue, which in their kind is preſumed to bee: the firſt degree therefore grounded on indifferent vertue, is iuferior to all the reſt: and the laſt, wherein vertue heroycall is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, being that of kings (called for the ſame reaſon by <hi>Homer,</hi> ſhepheards of people) is moſt ſuperiour: the other three bee part inferiour, part ſuperiour: ſeeing the ſecond more noble then the firſt, muſt giue place to the third, fourth, and fift: the third ſuperiour to the firſt and ſecond, ſhall giue preeminence to the fourth and fift, the fourth, before the other three inferiors, ſhall yeede preeminence to the fift.</p>
            <p>If I conceiue you rightly (added <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) you would ſay that priuate Gentlemen muſt giue place to Countes, Counts to Marqueſſes, Marqueſſes to Dukes, Dukes to Kings, and this ſtandeth with reaſon. Although in <hi>Germany</hi> it may bee through abuſe, Countes goe before Marqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: as alſo in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> Princes before dukes. To this title of Prince (ſaid <hi>Varano</hi>) I haue aſcribed no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular degree of nobilitie, conſidering it is an attribution to al great Lords, &amp; that diſtinguiſheth not one pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tate from another, but the prince from his ſubiects: &amp; if it be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aſcribed, it agreeth as ſeemes, to the eldeſt ſons of kings
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16643:119"/>and Dukes: I beleeue alſo (ſaid <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) that not without ſome ſpecial reaſon, you haue omitted the principalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Nobilitie, whereunto all thoſe noble, and moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, doe willingly giue place, and that is the degrees of the Emperour and Pope. The Emperour as Emperour, and the hie prieſt as Pope, cannot concurre (anſwered <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano</hi>) with the definition of nobilitie, nor make any order of nobilitie: and I ſay, as Emperor, or Pope: For there is no impediment, but that one choſen Emperour, or Pope, may come of royal and moſt noble ſtocke, which may manifeſtly appeare vnto you, ſeeing a man brings nobilitie from his mothers womb, but ſo can he not bring with him, either the Empire, or Popedome, ech of theſe degrees being diſpoſed by election and not by ſucceſsion: but a man may be borne, a Marques, a Duke, or a King, ſpeaking of ſuch principalities and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes as come by ſucceſsion. And though Emperours goe before Kings, and the Pope not only before Kings, but alſo, before the Emperour himſelfe: of this, nobilitie is not the cauſe, but their dignitie, the which noteth in thoſe ſubiects ſo great excellencie of vertue as is woorthy of all ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie. Howe can it be, replied <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> but if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Pope, haue prerogatiue to diſtribute the greateſt titles of nobilitie, conſidering they may make, Counties, Marqueſſes, Dukes and Kings, that they ſhould not be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea and moſt noble themſelues? And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> I proued vnto you by liuely reaſons, that no Prince, how mighty ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, can giue nobilitie, although he may adorne, and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it, with titles, enfeoſments, and honors, which be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, not ſo much of nobilitie, as vertue: but if I ſhoulde graunt you, that the Emperour or Pope, might make an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man noble, yet coulde you not conclude for this, that they were to be recounted in the number of thoſe noble: for the Sunne alſo is of power to produce heate in theſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bodies, yet the Sunne (if wee will giue credite to the Philoſopher) is not hote himſelfe. Very wel (ſaid <hi>Gual.</hi>) I now vnderſtand you, your meaning is, that the Emperor and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16643:119"/>be noble virtually, but not formally (to vſe theſe ſcholaſtical termes) which hath no other ſignification, but that they in one ſort more excellent the thoſe noble themſelues, poſſeſſe nobilitie, as they that haue the authoritie to create &amp; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Nobilitie: and for this I reſt ſatisfied, although I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire yet to vnderſtand ſomewhat further, whether in euerie one of theſe orders of nobilitie, there bee degrees of more and leſſe, or if all thoſe that are of the ſelfe ſame degree and order, be equally noble: ſo that amongſt them no prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence occurreth. In that thoſe noble of the ſelfeſame order, (anſwered <hi>Varano</hi>) when they meete togither, cannot ſet all vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one ſeat, nor be comprehended in one place &amp; circuite, being neceſſarie, that one muſt needes ſit on the right hand, another on the left, one aboue, and another vnderneath: ſo is it requiſite for the giuing of due place to euerie one, that ſome circumſtances of better and worſe, bee conſidered, which circumſtance and difference for all this, ſhall not bee ſpecificall, nor change the nature or ſubſtance of the thing, but rather be vniuerſall and general, to all the orders of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: And ſurely it is verie conuenient, that amongſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate gentlemen, there be no account at al made of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or precedence: for beſides the decency for yong men to giue place to the elders, it is further liberal educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and noble courteſie, for one Gentleman to honour ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, labouring euer to aſsigne him the ſuperiour place, but amongſt great princes, there is ſpeciall returning made of it, and often times queſtion is mooued, touching preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. And what is the difference? (ſayde <hi>Gualinguo.</hi>)</p>
            <p>In my iudgement (anſwered <hi>Varano</hi>) the differences are of two ſorts, which in al orders of Nobilitie, be worthie to be equally counterpeaſed, and whereunto in al reaſon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence is to be giuen: one is, antiquity of bloud, that is, the number of worthie predeceſſors, the other is, that Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which is termed the foure diſcentes, that is, of thoſe who diſcend from foure generations, not onely of men, but alſo of women noble, and this kind of nobilitie is ſo highly
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16643:120"/>eſteemed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> as that the Catholike King giueth the Knighthoode or order of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> to none but ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as beſides the demerite of their owne proper vertue, proue alſo this lineal diſcention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gualinguo</hi> replied no more, and ſignior <hi>Hercules</hi> now weary of diſcourſing, thinking he had ſufficiently ſatisfied the Queenes commaundement, would haue giuen place to ſome other recreation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; but the Queene beckened to Signior <hi>Antonio Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſano</hi> called the Greeke, to come before her, who being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued that day, ſtoode by in a corner of the roome to heare this argument, and ſmiling commanded him, that hee alſo ſhould moue ſome doubt, and oppugne Signior <hi>Hercules.</hi> This man is an honorable Cittizen of <hi>Scio,</hi> who after the Turkes occupying of that Iland, not being able to endure the hard ſeruitude of theſe Barbarians, came into <hi>Italie,</hi> and knowne in <hi>Ferrara</hi> for one learned, hee was intertained by his highnes, with a ſtipend, and had the publike reading of the greeke tongue committed vnto him: and further, being of pleaſant and iocund conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as one that taketh great delight in facet ieſtes, being audatious to vtter his opinion in any argument, hee is therefore moſt acceptable to all the nobilitie of the cittie, but eſpecially to women: hauing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done dutie to the Queene, he ſpake after this ſort. It were eaſie for me (moſt famous Queene) it hauing beene very doubtfull, to contradict, whatſoeuer hath beene deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by ſignior <hi>Hercules,</hi> but becauſe it wanteth not much of ſupper time, I will only alleadge, how I cannot tollerate, that women, being moſt imperfect creatures, ſhould haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part in nobilitie, as he rather like a ſicophant and ſlatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, then a ſincere approouer of truth, without any ſhame at all hath affirmed; he to himſelfe knowing very wel, that he ſpeaketh both againſt reaſon, and common vſe: which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge nobilitie from no other but the man, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly: for the female (if the philoſopher be worthy of credit) is no other then an imperfect male, framed through the error of nature: who intendeth euer to faſhion male, &amp;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16643:120"/>a woman compared to a man, hath the like proportion, as there is, betwixt ſence, and reaſon; and to argue ſomewhat more effectually, it is a thing certaine, &amp; by the ſame philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher affirmed, that in generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, male giueth forme, and female matter: this concluſion alſo in al vniuerſities is receiued, that al deformitie, and imperfection, in any thing generate, proceedeth from matter, as on the contrary, all good properties depend on forme: neither for any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, are incorporeal ſubſtances excellenter than thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, but that theſe with matter are conioynd, &amp; the other from it altogether ſeparate; which being true, how can it be affirmed, that a woman, who by adminiſtring matter, is the cauſe of al imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhuld giue to a man the leaſt ſhadow of nobilitie? That a woman hath no part in nobility, &amp; that ſhe wholy dependeth on the man, the lawes and records of Roman Emperors do confirme: and amongſt other, there is a text in <hi>Vlpine,</hi> where we reade, that husbandes bring their wiues, excellent dignitie, as alſo their fathers doe the like, while they com to be maried with men of common ſort: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, there is a record of <hi>Antony,</hi> that the women born of Conſolar, or Pretorian fathers may retaine the gentilitie of their ſtocke, being maried to noble men, and not of priuate condition, as alſo there is another teſtimoniall of <hi>Valente</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentino,</hi> that wiues may be honorable, though ignoble, &amp; be enobled according to the nobilitie of their husbands, but afterwards, if they take an husband of meaner condition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their dignity, they follow the quality of their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: who ſeeth not that from theſe lawes and recordes, a moſt infalible concluſion may be drawne, that women haue not any part in nobilitie: but follow the nobilitie &amp; quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of man, as the ſhadow doth the body: So that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues if they haue no nobilitie, how can they place it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an other? Wherefore Signior <hi>Hercules,</hi> laying aſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation, and the ouer great deſire you haue of their grace, and fauour, ſincerely confeſſe the trueth, and exclude wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as moſt imperfect creatures, from this eſteemed and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16643:121"/>embraced condition, which we cal Nobility: Signior <hi>Bariſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> (moſt excellent Queen) (ſaid <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano</hi>) putting confidence in a poetical &amp; vaine fable, that women naturally loue where they are not beloued, &amp; eſteeme greatly of ſuch as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne them, by reiecting women openly, laboureth to ſatisfie the great deſire he hath of them to be beloued and regarded: But as in cenſuring the natural diſpoſitions of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and as he boldly produceth ſlaunder for truth, ſo hope I, that in vaine he deſireth their grace and fauor: I affirme therefore, that women moſt beautiful and perfect creatures, may, not only enoble themſelues, but further with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vertue, make another partaker of Nobility, &amp; that they, as to forme man, ſo to accompliſh him entirely noble, are moſt neceſſary: I yeeld that nobility principally dependeth on man; but ſo I adde withall: that the nobility of a woman ſo greatly importeth, as that he cannot be counted perfectly noble, who ſhalbe borne of a baſe woman: neither wil I vſe any other armes in ſubduing you, then your owne: For it is true, that in the ſeede of man, life is potentially conteined, which is forme: &amp; bloud in the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wombe is the matter, wherof the body is formed, ſo that the ſoule from man, and the body from woman, haue their original: But further alſo I auerre, that if noble forme, ſhalbe brought to noble matter the thing compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded wil be perfectly noble: but if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be baſe, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the forme be noble, the compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wil not be abſolutly noble, but ſhal want one degree of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility being that of matter. Tell me in earneſt, ſignior <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> would you not more reſpect theimage of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in gold, then the ſame, &amp; by the ſelfe ſame hand, engrauen in lead, or braſſe? and this would you do, neither for the form which is is the ſame, nor in reſpect of the artificer being alone, but only for the matter which is more beautiful, and excellent. I graunt you that material, and corporal things be leſſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then thoſe immaterial and corporeal: as alſo that matter is a cauſe of imperfection, as ſhe is the ſubiect of alteration, tranſmutation, and inſtabilite in things not permanent; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16643:121"/>comparing of the materiall and corruptible thinges one with another, they which haue more pure, and better diſpoſed matter, do queſtionleſſe proue the much more worthy and excellent things; which the Philoſopher here confirmeth, ſaying, that in all thinges wherein matter is required, the better matter ſhalbe the more beautiful, and excellent will they fall out: and to proſecute their purpoſe, if it be true, that the ſoule followeth the temperature of the body, as the learneder ſort affirme, and as wee our ſelues haue experience, how can you denie, that the temperature of the body, giuen by woman, ſhould not be of great mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the framing of nobilitie, as well as celeſtiall influence, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minde, if it haue a body euill tempered, and inclined to vice, can hardly be reſplendant by thoſe vertues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon nobilitie is grounded: You cannot denie, and I know it aſſuredly, but that the body made by woman, hath parte in nobilitie (although it adminiſtreth matter) ſeeing wee perceiue, that dayly from the qualities of the body, as from manifeſt caracters and demonſtrations, we vſually progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate another mans conditions, in that the ſhape, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, geſtures, and motions of the body, many times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vs to know a man or a woman, not ſo much as euer ſeen by vs afore, to be noble, or ignoble. You ſay, that woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is an imperfect man; admit I ſhould grant you this, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is falſe, yet would I affirme that this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is not ſubſtantiall, but accidentall: for the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher intendeth not, that ſhe ſhould be leſſe reaſonable, then man; but calleth her, imperfect man, in that ſhe wanteth but one thing only to be man, and this thing is of no importance to humane perfection: ſo that as the being more then wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, giueth not perfection to man, ſo doth not the beeing leſſe then man, bring imperfection to woman: although I thinke it as far off from truth, that woman is a defect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or formed againſt her intention, as I iudge it falſe and vntrue, that nature mindeth not the preſeruation of humane kinde, which no leſſe by woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then by man, is made perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16643:122"/>whereof the philoſopher aduiſing himſelfe, in the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame booke, he addeth, that nature, inteutiue to vniuerſall good, with ſpecial prouidence, faſhioneth, ſometimes male, and ſometimes female. The defects of nature, bee no other but monſters, and ſeldome are produced; women are ſo far off from being monſters, that of all thinges vnder heauen, there is not any one more excellent or beautifull; who not ſeldome, and in ſmall number, but in farre greater multitude then men, are produced into the worlde, through ſingular grace and fauor, of louing and gentle nature, and by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelfe of nature. Confeſſe therfore your offence, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Antonio,</hi> and demand pardon; for your <hi>Vlpian</hi> in thoſe imperiall recordes by you cited, ſhal not be ſufficient to mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the leaſt dramme of thoſe puniſhments, which from theſe Ladyes hang ouer your head, in defence of whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawes and recordes by you alledged, I will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the authoritie of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and a decree, of the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Venetian</hi> commonwealth, for manifeſtation, how great a portion women haue in nobility, <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Dranes,</hi> ſaith:
<q>
                  <l>This man his noble raca, by mother tooke moſt ſure,</l>
                  <l>For by the fathers ſide, baſe was he, and obſcure.</l>
               </q> Who ſeeth not, that by theſe verſes, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil</hi> intendeth, that women ſhould, not only haue a part in nobilitie, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that by themſelues they are ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to giue noble deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. The Venetian decree, commandeth, that the ſonnes of a baſe woman, although borne in lawful matrimony, ſhal not be accepted to the trial of nobilitie, neither in any ſorte be admitted to their magiſtracies, and councels; thoſe moſt prudent and noble Signiors imagining (as truly they may) that without the nobilite, and generoſitie of mothers, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie in children cannot be preſerued immaculate. If wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, added the Greeke, be incapable of thoſe vertues, that make men noble, &amp; famous, how can it be, that they ſhould haue any part in nobilitie? except peraduenture, you think, that the practiſe of needle and ſpindle, deſeruedly ordained to women, are amongſt all liberall artes, the moſt noble. And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano:</hi> The needle, and ſpindle vſed of women with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16643:122"/>auarice, as they are noble and commendable exerciſes, ſo be they no impediment, but that they may proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be capable of al thoſe vertues, as wel to cuſtomes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining, as to the minde which concur with men: ſeeing they want none of thoſe faculties, nor any of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which the mind imploieth in vertuous operations. But if God and nature, neuer made any thing in vaine, as all the wiſe affirme, then we cannot ſuppoſe, that vnderſtanding ſenſes as wel interior, as exterior, and alſo the corpore all inſtrumentes that women haue like to men, bee made in vaine, and that they as wel as men, may not vſe the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the acquiring of prudence, knowledge, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and finally, for the practiſing of any liberall art: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diuine Philoſopher, in fauour of women, in his common wealth, by liuely reaſon, laboureth to prooue, that women are apt to al thoſe things, whervnto men accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelues, as alſo are capable of heroicall vertue: and <hi>Plutarch</hi> made a book of the vertu &amp; excellency of women And although the Philoſopher affirmeth, that betwix: women and men there is the like proportion, as betweene ſence and reaſon: yet intendeth he not by this, that a man ſhould be reaſonable, &amp; a woman depriued of reaſon: but hee dilating of domeſticall ſocietie, minding to inferre, that as ſence naturally muſt obey, and reaſon command, ſo in the beſt gouernment of an houſe, a woman naturally ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, &amp; a man command. And this iuriſdiction which a man hath ouer a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaith he, ought to be a ciuil, &amp; not ſeruile dominion: and a little afterwards, he addeth, that though a woman haue not mortall vertues in that perfection as hath a man, yet notwithſtanding, that ſhee alſo is indued with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, iuſtice, temperance, &amp; with that prudence, which of it ſelf is ſufficient to obey well, towardes him that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as well howe to commaunde. Although women, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Greeke, haue in them thoſe poyntes by you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, yet are they with ſo many other euill qualities ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, as that hardly they can effect any thing good.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16643:123"/>As they that are naturally cold, of bodies tender, ſoft, &amp; ouer delicate, nature hauing framed them, rather for procreation of man, than for any other effect: ſeeing in all other reſpects, they are but impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: therfore <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid, that if the world could be without woman, our conuerſation ſhould be like vnto God: this great wiſe man, by this minding to inferre, that man liuing in the company of ſo imperfect a creature, he could not but leade a miſerable life. But that you ſignior <hi>Hercules</hi> beleeue not, that I vtter as we prouerbially ſay, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wind, and that I am rather a ſlaunderer, than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of trueth, heare what the Philoſopher ſaith, deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of women: Woman is apt to mourning, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and deſpaire: ſhe is enuious, ſlaunderous, bitter, obſtinate, penſiue, impudent, a liar, ſlouthful, fearful, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be deceiued: And the Philoſopher in the ſixt of his lawes affirmeth, that feminine ſex is ſo wicked, and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo malitious, as that hardly it can be brought in ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder the lawes. What thinke you of the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons theſe Philoſophers attribute to women? are they not ſufficient to ſhew, how worthy they be, to haue any part, or preeminence, in nobility? Defend them as much as you wil, for you ſhal neuer make me beleeue, that of an aſſe, may be made a gallant courſer. If at this day (anſwered <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano</hi>) al writings were not repleniſhed, with the praiſes of women, I would contend with magnificent phraſe to ſet foorth the greatnes of their vertue: ſeeing the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of heroical ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in women, ancient, and of theſe times, is no leſſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, then in men, but conſidering their commendations are already well knowne, it is not now my intention to play the Orator: onely as a defender of equitie, I will affirme ſo much, as may ſuffice for the brideling of your maledictions. It is true, and I denie it not, Signior <hi>Antonio,</hi> that the author of nature, minding to place, the flower of beauty in women, faſhioned them, with a beautifull, ſoft, and delicate body, to the end that, together with the ſenſe of ſight, giuing delight to feeling, they might inflame in man that deſire which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16643:123"/>eternitie: whereupon, as in woman, beauty is a great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, ſo to be ſoft and delicate, procureth in her no imper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection: but if that be true which the Philoſopher affirmeth, that thoſe delicate of skin &amp; fleſh, are the more pregnant of wit, we may conclude, that women are more apt than men, to ſcience, ſapience, and all thoſe vertues, which moſt of al in men appeare. It is alſo true, that Nature intentiue to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in al kinds hath placed a female ſex, &amp; male, or the vertue of the one and other; but ſo is it falſe, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is produced to no other end, than for the fourming of man: for to beget their owne likes, is the proper end, of pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and creatures vnreaſonable; but of the reaſonable creature, felicitie is the proper end, which man in this life can neuer enioy without woman, which by teſtimony of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher is confirmed, who in his Oeconomiks ſaith, That man, as other creatures is not made onely to bee, but to be well, and therfore the naturall conuerſation of woman, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him, not ſo much to generate, as from her to receiue great benefit, which being true, as doubtles it is, ſo ſhal it be a ſpecial hereſy to affirm, that a woman is any burden, or that without the woman our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation could be happy, for this repugneth to reaſon, experience, &amp; to the authoritie of this great Philoſopher, who alſo affirms, that the family can not be perfect without woman: &amp; that as a woman is the halfe of a family, ſo be women the halfe of a Cittie: and further, in his Oeconomy he ſaith, there can not be any thing more holie, or worthier of a wiſe man, than to ſeeke coniunction with an excellent and commendable wife, and by her to bring forth children: as alſo that to a man of ſincere minde it is no waies befitting, raſhly to conuerſe with euery woman, to the end that of a corrupt wife, he beget not children like their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: by which words, it may eaſily be imagined how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Philoſopher eſteemed the mothers nobilitie &amp; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie in procreation of children. Further with the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Homer,</hi> he affirmes, that in this life, there cannot greater felicity befal men, than when the husband, and wife gouern
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16643:124"/>their familie with one wil and conſent. And <hi>Heſiodus</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to <hi>Catoes</hi> ſeueritie, ſayd, that three things to a man were Verie neceſſary, an houſe, a wife, and a yoke of oxen, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to teſtifie, that domeſtical conuerſation with a woman, was neceſſarie for the good and happie life of a man. And the Philoſopher in his Oeconomikes, ſaith, that the husbande who eſteeneth not his wife, is no leſſe ingrate, then hee, which contemneth his benefactor: by this inferring, that woman is not only a comfort, but alſo to man a ſpecial bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Seeing the honeſt &amp; chaſte woman is, not only a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to her husband in his bed &amp; contentments, but further, an eaſe to his labors, in his afflictions, a comfort, in his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities a medicament, full of louing and affectionate ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, neither can man, without the aſsiſtance of the woman, gouerne well his houſe, ſeeing whatſoeuer the man getteth abroad, ſhe faithfully diſpoſeth &amp; preſerueth in the houſe. But whom will wee beleeue, if we giue no credite to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience? Do not we our ſelues find, that without women, there is no pleaſure or ſweete contentment to be taſted, as they, who with their ſweetnes, temper the bitter of this our life, the which without women would be more ruſticall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culte, then that of the moſt wilde &amp; ſauage beaſts, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing from our hearts, vile and baſe thoughts, eaſe vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, miſeries, and thoſe turbulent cares, that often accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie vs, and with their great beautie, euer repreſenting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eies, the image of diuinity, ſo far off are they from withdrawing vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthie enterpriſes, that rather they ſtir vp our wits, &amp; exalt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to knowledge of greateſt &amp; higheſt things. But this your deprauatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is exceeding great, Signior <hi>Antonio,</hi> ſeeing, to procure credit to your calumniations, you Vſe the Philoſophers authority, in ſiniſter ſence, who thogh deſcribing the nature of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he placeth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the exceſſe of ſome wicked inclination, yet doth he not altogither free men from them: but which is worſe, you a prodigal diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſer of their rebukes, &amp; in their commendations, moſt couetous, ſpend many ſuperfluous wordes, in diſcouering their vices,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16643:124"/>malignantly concealing their are vertues: and yet your own conſcience knoweth, that in the ſame place by you cited, he deſcribeth women to be more merciful than men, better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue of memory, more vigilant, more ſober: And <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Menone,</hi> and in the fift of his Commonwealth, eſteemes wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; in a maner equall in vertue with man, who ordained, that the gouernment of the Citie, the magiſtracies, as well of warre, as peace, and all other offices, ſhould be common betwixt men and women: and the Philoſopher, although he eſteeme not woman in euery reſpect, equal with man, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, proportionable, he attributeth vnto them, temperance, iuſtice, &amp; fortitude: but if without preiudicing truth, I ſhuld grant you, that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> naturally were inclining to ſome vice, I would alſo affirme, that they are ſo much the more to be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, by how much ſubduing their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked inclinations, they liue vertuouſly. Here <hi>Varano</hi> ſtayed: The Greeke beeing about to reply, as hee who wanteth no words, the lady <hi>Tarquinia Molza</hi> ſmiling ſaid, Now for gods ſake proceed no further, Signior <hi>Bariſano</hi> but bee contented with what you haue hitherto ſpoken, in reproch of women, to the end theſe Ladies, who heere round about attend, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly prouoked againſt you, after the maner of <hi>Baccides,</hi> make you not a new <hi>Orpheus,</hi> The Greeke laughed &amp; ſaid theſe Gentlewomen, moſt gratious Ladie, haue rather cauſe to thanke me, than to be offended: For if I had not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted Signior <hi>Hercules,</hi> they ſhoulde neuer haue heard ſo great commendation, as hee hath beſtowed on them: and I am aſſured, that the more I had charged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with blame, the more had their praiſes like the Palme tree, reached vp euen vnto heauen. With theſe wordes the diſcourſe was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Queene perceiuing, that it would not be long ere the Court returned, commaunded the Lady <hi>Camilla Mosti,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Camilla Beuelacqua,</hi> that they ſhoulde dance: when they ſodainly taking hands, troad two meaſures to the ſound of the lute, and danced the Canaries with good grace, &amp; to the contentment of thoſe that beheld them: but

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16643:125"/>who after modeſt refuſall, in the ende accepted this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Empire: Euerie one ſtoode doubtfull, expecting, what the new Queene would command, for entertainment of that euening, when ſhe, after ſome indifferent meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaid: Amongſt al the goods termed external, or of fortune, me thinks, that after honor, riches holdes the chiefeſt place, we ſeeing by experienſe, that riches in a maner of al men are deſired, they iudging, that nothing is more proportionable to humane felicitie, than riches: I therfore conſidering, that the other day honor, and yeſterday nobilitie was very well diſcuſſed, prouided, I thought, that this ſhuld be acceptable to the company, I would make election of him, who to day ſhould diſcourſe of riches: and I beleeue this would not bee greatly from the purpoſe, Signior <hi>Hercules <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano,</hi> hauing by liuely reaſons auerred, that riches are the ſupportance, &amp; ſtay of Nobilitie. Then all the ſtanders by began to ſay to the Queen &amp; among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that this could not but be a moſt pleaſing and profitable diſcourſe: and they were very inſtant, that ſhe would commaund, who might thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate. The Queene therefore turning to Counte <hi>Hercole Taſſone,</hi> a Gentleman of good cuſtomes, and with good let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters adorned. You <hi>Signior Conte,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſhall be the man, who muſt vndertake this enterpriſe, to diſcourſe of riches: prouided, it may bee lawfull for any that will, to contradict you in all thoſe things, which to them ſhall not ſeeme alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or conuenient: as alſo, that you in like maner be enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make anſwer, according to the begun methode and courſe. Seeing it ſo pleaſeth your Highneſſe (renowmed Queene) ſaid Count <hi>Hercole,</hi> that I, among ſo many of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worth than my ſelfe, ſhould be he to vndertake this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den &amp; charge, not to oppugne your Highneſſe iudgement, which I eſteeme far aboue my owne, I neither can, or wil in any ſort refuſe it: and ſo much the more willingly wil I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, by how much it is permitted any one to contradict me: For I hauing (as the reward of my barren inuention) little or nothing at al to bring forth, riches in my hands may

I both euer was, and am now more then euer, farre off from their opinion, and holde this as a firme concluſion, that a man in this worlde, cannot enioy a perfect and good life, without riches: conformable to which my opinion, aſsigning the proper definition of riches, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that it is no other, but an heape and collection of all ſuch inſtrumentes, and meanes, which to the ſuſtentation, benefit, and ornament of an houſe, and ciuill life, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiye; without which, man cannot be called perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie:
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16643:126"/>&amp; therefore I ſay, it is an heape of al thoſe inſtruments, becauſe any of theſe failing, a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abſolutely be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rich: as alſo I affirme, that without riches a ciuill man can not bee happy: it beeing the principall inſtrument where with to exerciſe vertue; and therfore riches is no leſſe worthy, by men to be eſteemed, than it is: theſe inſtruments, which gathered togither, make that heape, which we call ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is diuided into ſeauen partes, that is, poſſeſsions, cattell, houſes, mony, iewels, rich furniture, and ſeruants: poſſeſsions &amp; cattell, ſerue for ſuſtentation of humane life: houſes, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and ſeruants for benefit: pretious iewells, and rich fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for ornament. He then may truely be ſaid to be rich, who hath ſufficient, land, mony, heards, flocks, and of al other ſorts of creatures, aſwel commodious as delectable: hee that hath a conuenient and faire houſe, rich furniture, as well in veſtments as ornaments of the houſe: and that poſſeſſeth al theſe things ſecurely and iuſtly, being his after ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, as that he may ſel or beſtow them at his pleaſure, and ſhall generally vſe all theſe things, partly for commoditie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotting ſome of the other onely to ornament and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Let him haue therefore, his farmes and poſſeſsions both fruitful, and beautifull: ſeeing fruitfulnes ſhal turne to his benefit, and beauty to his pleaſure, and contentment: It is then requiſite, they be planted and graffed with goodly rowes of vines, and fruitfull trees, and neare vnto them, a fine ſummer houſe, with gardens, faire orchards, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt, and ſhadowy groues, of which orchards, and gardens, he ſhall not make any emolument of importance, but onely vſe them for pleaſure and delight: I conclude therefore (moſt excellent Queene) that who in ſo many commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhal be aboundant, may be termed fortunate and happy, if hee be alſo of them a faithfull deſtributer and diſpenſer.</p>
            <p>Heere <hi>Taſſone</hi> making ſome pawſe, the Greeke, eyther beleeuing he had no more to ſay, or at the leaſt, very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, to contradict, ſtepping forward: Your diſcourſe ſaide he, Signior Conte, hath had in it this one thing good,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16643:127"/>that it was but ſhort and breefe: touching thereſt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion you inferred is altogither falſe, contrarie to diuine and true Philoſophie, the which by liuely reaſons I hope to make knowne to this moſt famous Queen, all theſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ladies, and moſt noble knights. Soft and faire (ſaide <hi>Taſſone</hi>) peraduenture you will not find it ſo eaſie to prooue my concluſion falſe, as you haue beene ready to cutte off my diſcourſe. Pardon mee (replied the Greeke) if I haue bin ſomewhat too forward: for ielous of publike good, I could not tollerate, that you ſhould further proceede, deliuering falſe doctrine: not being any thing more contrarie to truth, then to place riches in the number of thoſe goods, which are proportionable to humane felicitie, it being in effect no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a maſſe and heape of thoſe externall euilles, which of themſelues are ſufficient to breake and diſcipate all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall goods, whereof whoſoeuer is poſſeſſer, hee is woorthie to bee called happie. The truth of which my concluſion, I hope to prooue vnto you, by the reaſon and authoritie of the wiſeſt Pholoſophers. And beginning firſte from the verie birth and originall of riches, it cannot bee good, ſeeing they ſpring from a corrupt and peſtilent generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they being the infamous ofſpring of Couetouſneſſe, and guilty euen of the ſame flagition: and therefore the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſayth: euerie rich man is wicked, or the heire of a wicked man: this man hath beene enriched by vſuries, he by ſpoyles, another by treaſon: one is made rich by flatterie, another gaineth by inceſt and adulteries: a third ſort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance themſelues by lyes: there be ſuch as make benefit of their owne wiues, daughters, and ſiſters, as alſo to others, bloudſhedding is profitable: Finally, it is but verie rare that wealth is gathered togither iuſtly, and with honeſtie, ſo that if it ſhould bring felicity to man, wee might conclude, that felicitie were no other but a reward of iniquity. I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alleadge, how that is not good, which maketh not good the poſſeſſor thereof, but riches do not only, not make good, but procure the poſſeſſor of them to be wicked. That riches
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16643:127"/>cannot make their poſſeſſor good. <hi>Seneca</hi> teſtifieth, ſaying, What do riches aduantage a foole, ſeeing by them he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not become wiſe? but that they make a rich man to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, it may by the teſtimony of the Philoſopher be proued, who after this manner deſcribeth the properties of the rich: the rich ſaith he, are proud, great iniuriers, inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, delicate, &amp; intemperate. And <hi>Seneca</hi> conformable to this ſayth, that riches puffeth vp the mind, hatcheth inſolence and pride, acquireth enuie, diſturbeth the minde, and induceth feare, whereas on the contrarie, modeſt pouertie maketh a man modeſt, induſtrious, ſecure, &amp; is as it were a whip, that ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth one to vertue: therfore <hi>Arceſilaus</hi> ſaid, that though po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty were bitter, yet brought it forth excellent children. And good <hi>Diogenes</hi> called pouertie, the wiſedome that by it ſelfe was learned: minding to inferre, that pouertie, &amp; not wealth, maketh a man wiſe: Thirdly, I will alleadge, how that it is no true good by an honeſt man to bee eſteemed, whereof the man wicked may as well bee poſſeſſor as the good, yea, be he neuer ſo odious or contemptible a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And who ſeeth not that a ruffian, bawd, or any other common Vintner, may not bee a poſſeſſor of riches. Fourthly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt humane kind, that is no conuenient or proper good, which cannot be poſſeſſed without the wrong of many, but ſuch is wealth, in that one cannot bee rich, but many muſt therefore become poore: therefore riches is no true good: Finally, that cannot be good, which to humane generation is an occaſion of infinite euill: But riches are of this nature, for from them ſpring diſcordes, contentions, wars, enmities, rancois, and other ſuch like euilles, therefore they are not good. Signior Count affirmeth, that this beatitude which we terme riches, ſerueth both for profit and ornament to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life: and if hee liued commodiouſly that had need of many things, this concluſion ſhould bee true: but who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that the richer any man is, of ſo many thinges the more hee hath need, hee not beeing able to vſe or preſerue wealth without many inſtruments and helps? and therfore
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16643:128"/>that ſometime is true, that whoſoeuer poſſeſſeth much, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth much: and contrariwiſe, hee that meaſureth his aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, not by ſuperfluitie, but by natural neceſsity, hath need of litle: But what commoditie ſo great may riches bring, as may recompenſe the iealouſie and care they miniſter vnto man, or requite that danger, which putteth to compromiſe the ſoules health, and bodily ſecuritie of him rich? The rich, &amp; not the poore, are a prey to murtherers, theeues, menquel lers, againſt theſe be poyſons practiſed, and theſe be the men, who in ſtrongeſt caſtles fear trecheries: O happy riches may we then wel ſay, ſeeing they art no ſooner poſſeſſed, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie faileth them. And what ſhalwe ſay of ornament? It cannot be denied, but that coſtly garments, pretious iewels, ſumptuous pallaces, magnificent furniture, are a ſpeciall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and glorie to the poſſeſſor thereof, that to haue a cheſt repleniſhed with gold and ſiluer, to be euer accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a great traine of ſeruitors, make a man worthy of great eſtimation. But O moſt tranſitorie kinde of glorie, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, by darkeneſſe it ſelfe, ſeeketh after light, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that in faire apparrell, and ſumptuous pallaces, men admire the nature of matter, arte, and the architects inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather than the poſſeſſor of al theſe, and that the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of iewelles is their owne proper ſplendor, and not of the man that weareth them: as alſo gold &amp; ſiluer, is no other but red, and white earth, eſteemed of only, through mens er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; finally, to be enuironed with many ſeruants, is nothing but to be beſet with many enimies, which be ſo much the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to offend, as the other be externall, and theſe domeſtical enemies. If all theſe commodities gathered together, moſt renowmed Queene, ſerue for benefit, and ornament to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, or whether they make a man happy or vnhappy, anyone of iudgement may diſcerne: for my part. I would ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther affirm, that if felicitie (as ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) is our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per good, &amp; cannot by any accident whatſoeuer be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, then that riches therein ſhuld haue no part, as it that by fortune giuen, may by her alſo, in a moment be taken away:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:16643:128"/>As further I would affirme, that cheefe good in this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, were no other, but a ſtable and conſtant tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of minde, which deſpiſing al thoſe goods whereof for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is proude; and aboue all others, inſolent riches, to bee onely confident in vertue: Notwithſtanding, I attende my anſwere.</p>
            <p>Beholde (moſt illuſtrous Queene) anſwered <hi>Taſſone,</hi> one of that erronious crew, who iniuried by fortune, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, contendeth to proue, that ſhe hath not, ſo much as the leaſt intereſt in humane felicity, &amp; that the goods ſhe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly adminiſtreth, amongſt which, riches are of no ſmal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, are not to bee recounted in the number of humane goods, as diſproportionable vnto that, which of it ſelfe being ſufficient, is called chiefe good: notwithſtanding, I hope by ſo liuely reaſons, to diſcouer this hypocrifie, as that there ſhal not be any of ſo ſimple iudgement, who giuing credite to his allegatious, will become a contemner of riches. I ſay then, that man, as hee is in forme from other creatures diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſo is his end from theirs, verie diuerſe: the ende of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, is no other, but liuing, to generate thoſe like themſelues. Man borne in the Kingdome of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fortune, is not onely to liue and generate, but to liue well and happily: Nature of her ſelfe prouideth for other creatures, thinges ſufficient vnto life: Nature procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth man to liue, but reaſon and Fortune cauſe him to liue well: creatures liue after the lawes of Nature, man liueth by Reaſon, Prudence, and Arte: liuing creatures may liue a ſolitarie life, man alone, beeing of himſelfe inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and by Nature, an euill creature, without domeſtical and ciuill conuerſation, cannot leade other then a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and diſcontented life: and therefore, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſayth very wel: That man which cannot liue in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill companie, either he is a God, or a beaſt, ſeeing only God is ſufficient of himſelfe; and a ſolitarie life beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with a beaſt. Want therefore, and naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of companie, and not fire (as others falſely affirme)
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16643:129"/>gaue beginning to houſes, villages, and Citties, which houſes, villages, &amp; citties, as without their neceſſary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, they cannot be ſuſtained, ſo without wealth are they of themſelues inſufficient, wealth beeing the principall of thoſe inſtruments, that maintaine houſes &amp; cities: now a city being nothing elſe, but a body of men vnited together, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of it ſelf to liue, it is neceſſary, that like to a humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it be compounded of vnlike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, the which in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and dignitie, among themſelues vnequall, all notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding concurre to the good eſtabliſhment of a Citty: wherevpon as it would be a thing monſtrous, &amp; incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, to ſee a humane body wholy compounded, of heads, armes, legs, or of other members vniforme in themſelues; ſo would it be altogether as diſproportionable, and a thing ſo would it be altogether as diſproportionable, and a thing of it ſelfe inſufficient, if all men in a Cittie, were artificers, husbandmen, ſouldiers, iudges, or of one ſelfe condition, &amp; qualitie: There cannot therefore be any ſo vncircumſpect, but he may perceiue, that for the preſeruation, and liuing wel of a city, it is requiſite, there be artificers, mercinaries, husbandmen, marchantes, ſouldiers, Iudges, Magiſtrates, Princes, and Prieſtes: which being (as it is) true; ſo is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conuenient, that there ſhould be poore, rich, noble, &amp; ignoble. And therefore they, who laboured to bring in a commonwealth, al men to one condition and qualitie, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a policie rather of celeſtial, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> terreſtrial men: hauing no leſſe erred, then did that Phiſition, who ſought to make harmonie of notes vniſone: for as of diuers notes and tunes it is compounded, and reduced onely to one note, ceaſeth then to be harmonie, ſo of the diuers qualities of men is a cittie ordained, and reduced to one condition of citizens; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is not then any more a cittie, nor of it ſelfe ſufficient. If therefore all theſe allegations bee true, you can neuer Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Antonio,</hi> baniſh riches out of a cittie, ſeeing they are a neceſſary inſtrument for her ſuſtentation, and well imployd, be the ſupporters not of vice, but of vertue, and liberall artes: as contrariwiſe pouertie is the proper nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16643:129"/>of artes mechanicall, which artes haue had their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, from nothing elſe, then from humane indigence. And if you, admitting riches to be in a cittie, ſhould but be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a iuſt diſtributer, I am ſure you would rather beſtow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on thoſe who exerciſed liberall artes, and were capable of vertue, then on mechanicall, mercenarie, or husbandmen; ſeeing theſe being vnapt to vertue, and rather inſtruments, then partes of a commonwealth, their ſordide liues requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it not, whereas otherwiſe it is requiſite, that vertuous men ſhould liue with ſome liberal and commendable decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Speake not therefore, Signior <hi>Antonio,</hi> againſt your owne minde, but yeelding to reaſon, freely confeſſe, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in themſelues are good, &amp; worthy to be placed, among thoſe goods wiſhed for: &amp; though ſometimes, they appeare wicked, yet is not this their owne defect, but rather the fault of his depraued minde, that poſseſſeth, and badly vſeth it: for as Signior <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano,</hi> yeſterday ſhewed, they are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of liberall artes, the proppe of Nobilitie, good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gentle cuſtomes. And therefore the Philoſopher ſaith, that doctrine, &amp; nobilitie, rather accompanie the rich, then poore, in that hee cannot haue leaſure, that wanteth commings in: affirming likewiſe, that from hence it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that the rich abounding in thoſe thinges, for want whereof, others commonly are vniuſt, and iniurious, rich men are better, then poore, and worthy to be called noble. I confeſſe, Signior <hi>Antonio,</hi> that vertue onely is the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer that frameth felicitie, but as the Artificer cannot work, without conuenient inſtruments, ſo vertu, without the gifts that nature and fortune ioyne vnto her, cannot bee perfect, nor true felicitie: but what need wee vſe authoritie, and argumentes, to perſwade this our Greeke, to fauour riches and rich men, ſeeing by his owne example, if not teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, wee may prooue, that riches are good, and rich men vertuous, and well inſtructed, wee ſeeing dayly, that hee as a vertuous man, and well brought vppe, ſo doth hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conuerſe with the rich, and altogether ſhunne the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16643:130"/>familiarity of them poore, as ſeperate from vertue, and all good cuſtomes: as alſo that he, by thoſe rich, as louers of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and men vertuous, is better beloued and eſteemed then the poore. It is true (ſaide the Greeke ſmiling) that I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the houſes of the rich, and not of the poore; But yet, as doth the Phiſition, who viſiteth the ſicke, and not the whole: as alſo, the ſelfe ſame Phiſition is more by the weake deſired, then the whole. But for all this, you not hauing ouerthrowne my reaſons, I aſſure you, they ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding firme, I minde not to change my opinion. I am ſure indeede (anſwered <hi>Taſſone</hi>) that you will neuer change the houſes of the rich, for the poore: for the poore enuie your vertue, and the rich loue, and ſtriue to imitate it: and therefore it will be no difficult matter for mee, ſeeing you affect the rich, to make you alſo reſtore due honour to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Beginning therefore at your firſt oppoſition, it is falſe, that riches either haue, or may haue, euill ſpring or originall, as thoſe that borne with the world, and with the ſame coeternall, in reſpect of themſelues, are good, and ſo knowne vnto you, by whom in fauour of felicitie, they are deſired and ſought after: but in that they may bee heaped vp togither, both by meane lawfull, and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yea, and through humane malice, for the moſt parte, they are by vnlawfull meanes acquired: hereuppon it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that riches grow from that corrupt ſtocke you haue ſpoken of: notwithſtanding, the defect is not in the riches, but in the man wicked, that badly acquireth, poſſeſſeth, and vſeth them: yet may they for all this, as I ſay, haue a good originall: For often times, together with honour, they are giuen in rewarde of vertuous actions, as alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, good Fortune, ſedulous induſtrie, honeſt frugalitie, may to another heape vppe riches, as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> in theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes teacheth,

            <p>I yeeld vnto you, that riches cannot make good the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of them, neycher can they make a foole, wiſe: ſeeing that onely internall goods, which be the perfections, and vertues of the minde are of force to make a man good: ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being a good externall, can neither make the poſſeſſor of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, good, or wicked: It is true alſo, that the Philoſopher deſcribing the cuſtomes of the rich, termeth them, inſolent, proud, iniurious, and by ſuch like titles: yet ſo we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that in his Rhethorike, diſcourſing of the cuſtomes, and inclinations of all qualities, and conditions of men, thus deſcribeth them, as enclining to vice, to the end the orator, according to the diſpoſition and inclination of the auditor, might the ſooner moue him to that affection wherevnto he was bending, &amp; after this manner eaſily perſwade him: but he neuer affirmeth in any place, that riches is not to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among thoſe goods, that aſsiſt to humane felicitie, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both houſes, and citties, languiſh and conſume without riches. It is no leſſe true alſo, that euery wicked and vile man, may poſſeſſe riches, &amp; yet is this no obſtacle, but they may be good, &amp; by a vertuous man eſteemed: for if this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhuld preuaile, health, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of body, &amp; beautie, ſhuld be goods vnworthy of a vertuous man, ſeeing likewiſe in men contemptible they are many times found. Signior <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi> further alleadgeth, that riches to humane kind, is not profitable or good, ſeeing without the wrong of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they cannot bee poſſeſſed, in that one cannot bee rich, but many through the ſame muſt become poore, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is not aduiſed, howe hee contradicteth his owne ſelfe: for ſuppoſing pouertie to bee euil, he comes to confeſſe, that riches, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to pouerty, is good: he addeth more ouer, that riches is not good, becauſe it is occaſion of many euils, which amongſt men fall out, as controuerſies, diſcordes, warres, murders, thefts, rapines, and ſuch like. This
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16643:131"/>oppoſition, is a moſt preualent proofe for vnderſtanding, that riches is a principal good, ſeeing they mooue euerie ones deſire and will, to endeuour by all meanes to attaine vnto them: and therefore hee had aſsigned a truer cauſe, in ſaying, that humane malice and pertinacie, and not riches, were the cauſe of all the abouenamed euilles: wee might alſo prooue by more reaſons, that pouertie were rather the cauſe of thoſe inconueniences, ſeeing the want of thoſe things wherewith the rich men abound, kindleth deſire and greedineſſe in the poore, that afterwards is the cauſe of all thoſe euils, which euerie day are committed: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Philoſopher, contrary to your <hi>Arceſilaus,</hi> ſayth, that pouertie bringeth foorth ſeditions, and maleficences. Our Greeke yet further affirmeth, that riches is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, ſaying: that the richer any one is, the more things hee hath neede of: but if the definition of riches be true, of neceſsity his poſition muſt bee falſe, for where is the heape and collection of all neceſſarie inſtruments, for ſuſtentation, benefit, and ornament of humane life, there can bee no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or want of any thing: and though riches procure a man to bee iealous ouer him ſelfe, and ſometimes putteth him in daunger, yet from this reaſon can wee not conclude that they are wicked: but rather the contrarie, ſeeing there is no feare of looſing badde, but good thinges, which of their owne nature, bring the poſſeſſor into no danger, but rather is procured by mans couetouſneſſe and deprauation: as in like manner, luſt is the cauſe, that the chaſtity of a faire woman is hardly ſecure, and yet muſt we not therefore ſay, that beautie is a wicked thing. I grant vnto you alſo Signior <hi>Antonio,</hi> that in faire apparel &amp; ſumptuous pallaces, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of matter &amp; Architects wit is rather admired, then the rich poſſeſſer of theſe things: &amp; that ſplendor &amp; brightnes, is proper to the iewels, &amp; gold, and not to the man rich, who therwith adorneth himſelf, but not withſtanding this, if the rich man had not made this rich apparel, or built a ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſe for his own &amp; publike benefit, neither could the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16643:131"/>nature of matter, nor the Architects wit, &amp; inuention of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, procure admiration: as alſo the beauty &amp; ſplendor of iewels ſhuld remain buried in the inwardmoſt caues of the earth, except the rich man, diſcouering as it were the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Nature, ſhould not offer them to the beholders eies: beſide this, in all theſe ornaments, the beames of magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence ſhine, which is numbred amongſt the principalleſt vertues heroycall. To poſſeſſe therefore, and vſe all theſe things, both how, when, &amp; with conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meaſure &amp; quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, bringeth vnto man a ſingular decency, being truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be placed in the numbers of goods deſired; and to be ſought after, as in like maneral other kind of riches: I ſay likewiſe, that felicity is proper to vs, &amp; cannot be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: as alſo, that riches being a good of Fortune, remaineth in the power of the ſame fortune. But we muſt obſerue, that felicitie may be conſidered two maner of wayes, the firſt, as it dependeth of his proper efficient cauſe, which is vertue: the ſecond, as it dependeth not only of the efficient, but alſo of al cauſes inſtrumentall, and the circumſtances neceſſarily conioyned with the cauſe efficient, in the firſt maner conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is our own proper, &amp; cannot be taken away, becauſe vertue true productreſſe of felicitie, is not ſubiect to blowes of fortune, neither haue honour, riches, nor any other externall goodes in it any part. In this manner the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher obſerueth felicitie, in the firſt of his Ethikes, when hee diſtinguiſheth the felicitie of <hi>Platoes Idea,</hi> from Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honour, and thoſe contentments that the vulgar ſort eſteeme. In this manner alſo did hee conſider it in the ſeuenth of his Politikes, where hee ſayde: Felicitie hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth not vnto vs through the goods of Fortune, but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, the more hee poſſeſſeth of vertue and prudence, and after them frameth his opperations, the greater is his felicitie: and this is prooued by the teſtimonie of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who not for any good externall, but of himſelfe, is happie and bleſſed. Felicitie conſidered after the ſeconde manner; it beeing no other but a collection, and heape of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:16643:132"/>humane goodes, as well internall, as externall, which ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together concurre, by meane of vertuous action, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of perfect and chiefeſt contentment: although it can not be wholy taken away, yet notwithſtanding in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances it may be hindred. After this maner the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher conſidereth it in the firſt of his Rhetorike, where he doth not only place, the goodes of the minde, amongſt the parts of felicitie, but alſo the goods of the body, and thoſe externall: In this ſort alſo doth he obſerue it, in the ſeuenth of his Ethickes, where he plainely affirmeth, that an happy man, hath neede of goodes externall, and of fortune, to the end, that in his operations hee may not be hindred: which thing, ſaith he, being very wel knowne, proſperous fortune, and felicitie, by many come to be termed, the ſelfe-ſame things. We muſt further note, that the Philoſopher in the place by you cited, Vſeth theſe formall words: Chiefe good is our proper owne: being ſuch, as that hardly it can be taken from vs: He denieth not therefore, but that felicitie anay be taken away, but yet he ſaith, very hardly, minding to inferre, that it could not bee abſolutely remooued, but may peraduenture bee defrauded of his circumſtances. Out of which, wee may very well conclude, that felicitie ſhould be depriued of her principall inſtrument, wanting riches: and that hee which is not rich, can not be perfectly happy, conſidering that he cannot exerciſe the Vertue of liberality, beneficence, and magnificence, which make a man woorthie of honour.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes, Signior <hi>Antonio,</hi> ſaide the Queene, your cauſe is in ſuch ſort ouerthrowne, as that it booteth you litle to replie any further: and I am aſſured, that from theſe Signiors, you ſhould not receiue the leaſt ſuffragation of pouertie, if you were to gather their voyces by ſcruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>
            <p>It would not be a iuſt and indifferent ſcrutany (moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Queene, ſaide the Greeke, ſmiling) if the number of the rich were not equally ballanced, with as many poore:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16643:132"/>becauſe paſsion, which is euer in the rich predominant, and not equitie, would giue ſentence: Notwithſtanding I will accept your Maieſties iudgement, as a firme decree: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I further reply, expecting that one day I may bee made to conceiue, by one that with effects, and not words, ſhall prooue, that riches are good, and worthy of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man.</p>
            <p>And although other perſwaſions were not ſufficient, ſaide Count <hi>Guido Caleagnini,</hi> yet might experience mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it vnto you, which euery day ſheweth, that riches is not onely a neceſſary inſtrument of felicitie, but further, that among all worldly goodes, it holdeth chiefeſt place: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riches without labour, diſpenſeth liberally to him rich, of all other goodes, which the poore man by vertue, can not with great induſtrie attaine vnto: And it ſeemeth he richly borne, is in like manner borne gratious, vertuous, woorthie to be beloued of euery one, and commended: the which by you learned, being wel and rightly vnderſtoode, you dedicate your labours, not to the vertuous, but vnto the rich: And furthermore, wee ſee that Titles, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, are by Princes, rather diſpenced, to the rich, than to the poore, as likewiſe for one vertuous, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in their Courtes, wee may reckon tenne rich: as thoſe that are reputed, much more profitable and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the commonwealth and Prince. with their riches, than are the vertuous with their vertue.</p>
            <p>Howe greatly wealth exceedeth vertue (added Count <hi>Palla Strozzi</hi>) in my judgement, that wiſe aunſwere gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by <hi>Sophocles,</hi> to the wife of <hi>Hiero</hi> tyrant of Syracuſa, manifeſteth: For hee by her demaunded, whether it was better to bee rich or vertuous. I ſee the vertuous (aunſwered hee) euery day at the rich mens gates, but neuer did I ſee the rich at the gates of the vertuous, being an euident ſigne, that riches holdeth vertue as mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>Signiour Counte (aunſwered the Greeke) and if the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16643:133"/>rich would but look into their own defects, as they conceiue the neceſsities of the vertuous, the contrary would happen: for then the rich would reſort to the virtuous mens houſes, neither would they euer from them depart: for another can not giue iudgement, in that he himſelfe knoweth not: The wiſe and vertuous know what gold and ſiluer is, &amp; to what vſe their diſpenſation ſerueth. But of the rich queſtionleſſe many not knowing, what ſapience and vertue is, buried in the darkenes of their ignorance, they make thereof the like account, as did <hi>Aeſopes</hi> Cocke of the pretious ſtone: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in fauor of riches, you haue cited the example of a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, for ſo may <hi>Sophocles</hi> with that fooliſh woman be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſufficient for my part in fauor of vertue, to recite vnto you the beginning of a Letter, which <hi>Antigonus</hi> the moſt mightie king of <hi>Aſia</hi> wrote to <hi>Zeno Citico</hi> a moſt wiſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher: I, ſayd he, as I exceede thee in fortune, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſo in ſapience, liberall ſtudies, and perfect felicity, which thou poſſeſſeſt, I know my ſelfe far inferior vnto thee. The King knew himſelfe by the Philoſopher exceeded in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect felicitie, reputing riches &amp; glorie for things moſt vain: King <hi>Antigonus</hi> knew wel what he had neede of, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he drew neare vnto him, one that was wiſe: the which if many other rich men knew alſo, they woulde hunt after the vertuous, much more than they doe, neithes would they ſo ſwell, or be puffed vp with their riches wanting ſapience: for they might conceiue, that the rich without vertue are no other, but ſheepe that haue their fleece of gold, as the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous king <hi>Alfonſo</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> was wont to term the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alleadging, that rich men, like tapiſtrie hangings, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued rather for ornaments, of halles and chambers, than for any other purpoſe: they being in effect, not much vnlike to paynted images; but in his affaires hee vſed thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, who as they bee rare, ſo of neceſsitie, in Courtes they muſt needes bee the leſſe in number. But peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I haue ſaide too much.</p>
            <p>Speake what you pleaſe, ſaide Count <hi>Alfonſo Turcho,</hi>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:16643:133"/>for my part, I make no doubt, but that riches is one of the greateſt goods, that may befall a man in this life: yea, and I hold opinion, that the more riches increaſe, the more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicitie is augmented: ſo that hee moſt rich, may bee ſaide to be alſo moſt happy. In this laſt part, Signior <hi>Conte</hi> (ſaide <hi>Taſſone</hi>) you are deceiued, ſeeing felicitie rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in indifferent than exceſsiue riches. You hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (replied <hi>Tuncho</hi>) that riches is a good, I cannot ſee, but that riches increaſing, good is thereby augmented, and conſe quently felicitie.</p>
            <p>Goodes (aunſwered <hi>Taſſone</hi>) as hath other wiſe beene affirmed, are of diuerſe ſortes, that is, of the body, mind and of fortune. And betweene the goodes of the minde, and thoſe of Fortune, there is this notable difference, that exceſſe in the goodes of fortune, as are riches, either hurt, or help not him that poſſeſſeth them: but goodes of the minde, to the greater height they attaine, ſo much the more make they their poſſeſſor happy. And if Signior <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſano</hi> had tied himſelfe to this concluſion, that not riches, but immeaſurable riches, were rather impediment, than fur therance to liue well, and happily, I ſhould haue beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this opinion: For ſuperfluous riches bring often times vpon him rich, thoſe inconueniences, which hee hath recounted: and peraduenture in this reſpect, thoſe ſeuere Philoſophers blamed riches, therefore the Philoſopher ſaith, that proſperitie of fortune, when it exceedeth, it is an impediment to felicitie, ſo that in ſuch exceſſe, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon bee termed proſperitie. And in another place, likewiſe he affirmeth, that indifferent poſſeſsion of the goods of fortune, is woorthie to be counted beſt, the which eaſily obeyeth to reaſon, as doth exceſſe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And further he addeth in prayſe of mediocritie, that all thoſe indifferent rich, are apt to preſerue themſelues: in that they deſire not other mens goods, as doe the poore, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are theirs by the poore deſired, ſo much as the goodes of them rich: whereuppon they themſelues neyther cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuenting,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:16643:134"/>others, nor by others layed in waite for, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuenced, they liue without danger. In like manner <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilides</hi> affirmed, that for the happie ſtate of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; it was to bee wiſhed, that Citizens ſhould haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, yet ſufficient riches: minding to inferre, that ſo much riches ſufficed, as wherewith veitue might with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie be practiſed: and that thoſe, who in riches, power, or friendes do ſuperabound, are good Citizens, becauſe they neither can, nor will ſupport another mans dominion: that meane wealth is not onely ſufficient of it ſelfe to felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo to the happie ſtate of a common-wealth: by this it may be comprehended, that the Lawgiuers were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent rich: for <hi>Solon</hi> as wee reade in his verſes, was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent rich, &amp; ſo was <hi>Lycurgus, Charondas, Faleus</hi> Carthaginian, <hi>Hyppodamus</hi> Mileſian, and Finally, the greater part of all the others: ſo that it is euident, that moderate, and not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable riches, are the furtherance to happie life. I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſatiffied, if to this you haue deliuered, you adde but ſome firm &amp; ſound reaſon, ſaid count <hi>Alfonſo.</hi> And <hi>Taſſone.</hi> I commend your wit, ſeeing you relie not on bare authority, but behold the reaſon: It is a thing moſt certaine, that the inſtrument wherewith the artificer exerciſeth his trade, ought to be proportionable, both to the ſame artificer and arte: for if it bee diminiſhed, or too exceeding great, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the artificer, not the worke it ſelfe, will it ſucceede well. Riches therefore, being the inſtrument, wherewith a vertuous man practiſeth vertue, it is neceſſarie that after ſuch a ſort, they be vnto vertue proportionable, and the man vertuous, as neither through defect, nor exceſſe, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions (wherein felicitie conſiſteth) bee hindered: and in that moderate riches is betweene the defect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, this of neceſsitie muſt needes bee the ſufficient and proportionable inſtrument: and exceſſe ſhal either be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or no whit at all furthering felicity. But moreouer, if from increaſe of riches felicity ſhould take augmentation, conſidering riches may multiply infinitely, it wold alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that felicity, which is the ende of man, ſhould bee infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:16643:134"/>whereupon man, not being able euer to attaine vnto it fully, of all other things created, he onely ſhould faile of his proper end: I conclude therefore, that as without riches, there can bee no perfect felicitie, ſo the exceſſe of riches ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurteth, or helpeth not at all: and that mediocrity is an apt inſtrument vnto vertue, and an happie life. Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are ſo well grounded, ſaid <hi>Turcha,</hi> as that in them I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine fully ſatisfied. Out of doubt added <hi>Gualinguo,</hi> whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer cannot practiſe vortue with moderate riches, will much leſſe practiſe it with exceſſe: ſeeing ſuperaboundance of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is farre more proportionable to vice, then vertue: And ordinarily in them moſt rich, thoſe euil diſpoſitions are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, which by the Philoſopher are ripped vppe in his Rhetorick, ſeeing in that place he vnderſtandeth it by them ſuperaboundantly rich, and not by the other, rich with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity, conſidering that in them, inſolence, pride, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp; many other vices abound, wherof immeaſurable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is the proper nouriſhment. I beleeue (ſayd Count <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Beuelacqua</hi>) that ſo it is: but yet further I deſire to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, whether hee is rich that poſſeſſeth, or he that vſeth them, for of this I am doubtful, in that I ſee diuers, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they make thereof no vſe, yet are they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med moſt rich. Vain is poſſeſsion without vſe (anſwered <hi>Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone</hi> (as the diuine Philoſopher affirmeth in <hi>Eutimedo</hi>) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be rich conſiſteth, not only in poſſeſsion, but alſo, in vſing riches: &amp; he that ſhuld ſay, more in vſe then poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, might not peraduenture ſpeak much amiſſe, in that he which maketh no vſe of them, is in no other reſpect different from one poore, but that the poore man is poore through neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and hee through will and election: and therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not knowing, that to bee rich, conſiſteth principallie in vſing of wealth, are deceiued: &amp; not foreſeeing thus much, by forbearing the vſe of them, impoueraſh themſelues. Nay, and I promiſe you, I am of opinion (ſayde Counte <hi>Hercules,</hi>) that theſe ſorte of men are much more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the poore: for the poore deſire Riches to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16643:135"/>their wants, and theſe men hunt after them, to the end, that in aboundance, they might yet liue in want: neither can I imagine the cauſe and reaſon, of ſo great follie. Aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice (ſaide <hi>Taſſone</hi>) ſpringeth from a firme hope, of long life, and neuer thinking to die: for who is ſo fooliſh, that would ſpare to day, if he beleeued to die to morrow,? But a man promiſing vnto himſelfe, long life, as if hee were to liue euer, ſtoreth vp riches &amp; mony infinitely, hoping that one day he ſhal reioyce in them, and in this vaine hope, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe with aire, he liueth like a <hi>Camelion,</hi> and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the middeſt of abundance, dyeth in want. How can it be, ſaid count <hi>Scipio Sacrati,</hi> that to be in hope of long life, ſhould make a man couetous, we ſeeing by experience, that auarice, is a particular vice to old men, who hourely expect death? Olde men (ſaide <hi>Taſſone</hi>) do not expect, but feare death, as they that are much more deſirous of life, then yong men, and therefore <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> ſaide, that there was not any one ſo de crepite, which did not yet promiſe vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſome yeares of life: but for another cauſe alſo old men are couetous, for bloud in them comming to refrigerate, &amp; not being able to ioye any more in thoſe contentmentes, wherein youth is commonly prodigall: as alſo hauing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times proued want in times paſt, fearing the like ſhould happen to them againe, they addict themſelues to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp of mony, repoſing in it all their ioy, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hauing obſerued (ſaid the Count of <hi>Scandiano</hi>) theſe men, that greedie of riches, are called couetous, I finde them after ſuch a manner intentiue, to the heaping vppe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as that it excepted, all other riches ſeemeth vnto them nothing worth, which maketh mee beleeue, that in the poſſeſsion of mony confiſteth true riches: ſeeing by the meanes of mony, wee may iuioy all other riches, yea and it appeareth, that they who are monied, be in a certaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Tyrantes ouer others, as though all thinges ſhoulde obey vnto mony: And therefore <hi>Phillip</hi> the father of great <hi>Alexander</hi> was wont to ſaye, that there was not any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16643:135"/>ſo great and well munified, but if an affe laden with golde might but aproach it, woulde bee expugnable. It cannot be denied, (ſaide <hi>Taſſone</hi>) but that mony is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and in a certaine maner, neceſſary, to liue well, being impoſsible, or at leaſt wiſe very difficulte, to liue in common ſocietie, without exchange, or permutation of thinges: conſidering that oftentimes one hath need of that, whereof another aboundeth, now in that there can be no iuſt permutation, but by meanes of mony (as the other day Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualier <hi>Gualinguo</hi> declared) it being that which maketh all contracts iuſt &amp; equal, in this reſpect mony is truly worthy to be eſteemed, and placed in the number of riches: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in it ſelfe conſidered, it is no true, nor ſincere riches, as that which of it ſelfe, ſupplieth not the wants of nature, conſidering that one poſſeſsing it, may die for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirſt, colde, or any other want, no leſſe then hee that hath it not, which is confirmed by the fable of <hi>Mydas.</hi> And there vpon it proceedeth, that the riches of mony is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſatiable, yea &amp; the more the heap therof augmenteth, the more likewiſe increaſeth deſire, for mony ſerueth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to no vſe at all, as doth bread, wine, fruite, and al other riches, wherewith humane life, is ſuſtained, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the ſuperfluitie of which things cauſeth lothſomneſſe and ſacietie.</p>
            <p>Thinke you not (ſaide Signior <hi>Gualinguo</hi>) that mony of it ſelfe, without other helpe, deſerueth to be eſteemed, being compounded of ſo noble a matter as is gold or ſiluer? The which gold is ſo reſplendant and beautifull, as therefore it was conſecrated to the Sunne: as alſo that being moſt ſecure and temperate from all corruption, it was in like manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to <hi>Iupiter:</hi> whereupon, no maruaile if any one behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, hee remaine ſurpriſed and taken. Although ſiluer and gold (anſwered <hi>Taſſone</hi>) of alother mettals, be the faireſt and moſt beautifull, yet are they leaſt profitable: wherfore, hauing reſpect to that, which more benefiteth humane life, wee may make better account of iron, although of all other
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16643:136"/>mettall it be the groſſeſt: ſeeing of iron, and with iron, the inſtruments of all trades are made, and iron maketh men va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant amiddeſt the moſt cruell wilde beaſts: ſinally, in the cittie, and within our owne houſes, it maketh vs ſecure: which beeing knowne to wiſe <hi>Solon;</hi> he aduiſed <hi>Craeſus</hi> to change his aboundance of golde (ſhewed vnto him by that fooliſh King, for oſtentation) into iron, prognoſticating, that if he preſently did it not, his golde, kingdome, &amp; ſelfe, would be a prey to <hi>Cyrus;</hi> who emptie of golde, but laden with yron, and full of valour, came to aſſault him. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that mony in it ſelfe, is of ſmall or no aſsiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at all, to humane life; as that which by the Lawgiuers was inuented, to proue equalitie in bargaines, &amp; contracts: for a maſon could make no exchange with a ſhoomaker, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the building of a houſe, is of farre greater value, then a paire of ſhooes, if mony were not, which ballanceth the contract: And therefore mony by the Graecians was called <hi>Numiſma,</hi> as it were by the lawes ordained: for <hi>Nomos</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth law, and the Latines for the ſelfeſame cauſe, called it <hi>Nummus:</hi> and there is no doubt, but mony commeth to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, through the opinion only of men, who as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they haue eſteemed thereof, if for a little while, they ſhould but beginne to holde the ſame (as indeed it is) but baſe and vile, we ſhould finde it, no queſtion, but an vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitable waight and burden. That inuention of mony (ſaide Signior <hi>Patritio</hi>) ſerueth for no other vſe, but for permuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thinges, it appeareth by another reaſon: for hauing reſpect only to domeſticall ſocietie, within the limites of an houſe, where permutation is not requiſit; it is altogether vnprofitable. And how is permutation vnneceſſarie, or at leaſtwife vnprofitable in a houſe (replied, Signior <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arano?</hi>) Becauſe betweene husband and wife (ſaide <hi>Patritio</hi>) betwixt father and children, ſeruants and maiſters, and brothers, while they remaine together in one familte, that permutation is not requiſite, wherevnto mony concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for equalitie of bargaine and contract: and therefore
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:16643:136"/>mony, within the limites of an houſe is altogether vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but only ſerueth abroad in ciuill company, &amp; ſometimes for contract, and exchange. Me thinkes (ſaid Signior <hi>Scipion Gilioli,</hi> that general rule ſhould haue an exception: ſeeing in the houſe betwixt maſter and ſeruant, there is permutation, and mony taketh place; the ſeruitor offering his labor and ſeruice, to his maſter, and the maſter due hire to ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant in exchange: obſerue (ſayd <hi>Patritio</hi>) that by a ſeruant I intend not theſe, which go about euery day, ſeruing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time this man, otherwhiles that for hire: For theſe ſorte of people, be rather ſimilitudes, then true ſeruantes, as they that acknowledge not their maſter, for their head, neither feare by him to be puniſhed, for the inſolencies, they dayly commit in the houſe: wherfore they are altogether vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be placed in the number of thoſe, which make a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall ſocietie: being for the moſt part, vagabonds, and cooſeners, directing their actions, rather to ſome other end, than to ſerue their maiſters. But I meane that ſeruant, the vſe of whom not onely, but euen of his goods and ſubſtance is in the maiſters power, which by vs at this day is called a Slaue: for ſuch an one is a true ſeruitor, and one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall inſtruments wherewith a maſter gouernes his houſe. This man, partely for feare of his maiſter, as alſo through hope of liberty (the reward of good ſeruice) ſerueth his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter moſt ſaithfully: and betweene this ſeruant and his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, occurreth no permutation, wherein mony is requiſite. Nowe I conceiue (ſaide <hi>Gilioli</hi>) that your rulehath no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and that money is no riches, which paſſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them of one famille, although it be neceſſary for maintenance of the houſe, as Signior Conte hath very wel explaned, who in the argument of riches, hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo good ſatisfaction, as peraduenture litle remaineth wherof we may doubt.</p>
            <p>The which likewiſe, being by all the reſt confirmed, the diſcourſe ended, and his Highneſſe with the thriſe excellent Ducheſſe, euen now landed at the village of <hi>Coſandoli,</hi> the

The morning following, his highneſſe, the excellent Ducheſſe, and all the reſt of the Court, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard with deuotion, ordinary diuine ſeruice, they went roote by foote to the riuers ſide, where each one entred into their barge, except the Secretaries, Counſellors, and other Magiſtrates, who inuited by the Lady Counteſſe of <hi>Sala,</hi> the Lady <hi>Tarquinia,</hi> and by the moſt illuſtrous Lord <hi>Don Caeſare,</hi> accommodated themſelues in the <hi>Buccyntore,</hi> imagining diſcourſe would fal out vpon ſome noble ſubiect and argument: and amongſt theſe, was Signior <hi>Antonio Montecatini,</hi> of all Philoſophers of our age, the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, Signior <hi>Gainbattiſta Landerchi,</hi> the renowmed of the Lawes, Signior <hi>Benedetto Racualdi,</hi> Signior <hi>Achilli Fantini,</hi> Signior <hi>Gian Maria Criſpo,</hi> and Signior <hi>Cati,</hi> men, not onely in the profeſſion of the lawes moſt excellent, but in all other kindes of excellent and choyce ſtudies, learned and iudiciall. There were in like maner placed vpon the ſide of the bark, diuers companies of Muſitians (of which in his Court, there be many rate and excellent, to the end, that playing &amp; ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging togither to ſundrie inſtruments, they might with their melody no leſſe delight the ſence of hearing, then did the dames with their beuty, content the eyes &amp; ſence of ſeeing. But after that with pleaſure they had made ſome reaſonable way, dinner time beeing at hand, by the Queenes order, the tables were couered in the hall, and on the one ſide, the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16643:137"/>dames, &amp; thoſe roabed: oueragainſt whom ſate the Knights and men of order, the Queene her ſelf being placed at the end of the table, in regal maieſtie vnder a canopie. Dinner ended, which thrughout was accompanied with moſt melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious muſicke, there was by prouident officers, as on the water the cuſtome is, brought forth cardes, tables, &amp; cheſſe boordes. But the Queene with a ſigne hauing impoſed ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſpoke after this maner. As there be two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions of men eſteemed worthy of true honor, one of thoſe, learned, and the other of them, that make profeſsion of Armes, ſo is there many times diſputation, to whither of theſe preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is due: Conſidering therefore with my ſelfe, that in this noble aſſembly, of one ſide, here be the flower of the learned of our age, and on the other part, Knights, that in military profeſsion are moſt excellent: taking holde of this good oportunitie, I determine that to day, for entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our paſſage, by way of argument, it be diſcuſſed; which is moſt worthy of honor, the man learned, or the Souldier: and to the end, that in grapling together, there grow no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, I minde it ſhal be fought out by ſeuerall champions, which may be done, they learned chooſing out one for their parte that may ſpeake, as alſo the other, another: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no controuerſie can bee determined without a iudge: I will, that both partes being hearde, they ſhal ſtand to the ſentence, of Madam Counteſſe of <hi>Sala.</hi> This iudiciall order of the Queene, highly pleaſed the Lord <hi>Don Caeſar,</hi> and all the reſt of the Ladies: and they attended the Champions comming forth: for thoſe learned, after a low muttering and conſultation, they denounced Signior <hi>Patritio</hi> for Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion: and of the Knights parte, the Lord <hi>Guilio Caeſar Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaccio,</hi> not onely amongſt all the reſt, the oldeſt Souldier, and in knowledge of Armes moſt excellent, but further, a gentleman, very learned, eloquent, and with all manner of vertue adorned.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a verie deepe and doubtfull queſtion (moſt famous Queene) which you haue propounded to be diſputed of this day, ſeeing that Armes and Letters are both of them ſo Noble profeſsions, and ſo excellent, as that it is difficult to iudge, to whether of them the Palme is due: Conſidering by armes wee defende and amplifie kingdomes, and by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wee preſerue and gouerne the ſame, ſo that the one of the other ſtandeth in ſuch neede, that neither this without the other, can be iuſtly extended, nor the other without the firſt, be ſecurely maintained: Notwithſtanding, ſeeing it ſo pleaſeth your Highneſſe, that the tediouſneſſe of our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, be paſſed ouer with ſome ingenious and pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I wil contende to manifeſt, as a valorous Champion of the learned, that the ballance fitteth on our ſide: and in that the ſouldiour and ſcholler cannot ſit both on the ſame ſtoole, the Souldiour muſt giue place to the ſcholler. Now to come to the knowledge of truth, which we ſeek after, I think it neceſsary, that to diſcourſing briefly, we firſt of any other thing intreat of thoſe perfections, which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues are ſufficient to bring a man to his true ende, which is fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, to the end, that ſeeing in what degree and perfection
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16643:139"/>Letters ſtand, and in what art militarie we may draw out an infallible iudgement, to whome the firſt degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ought to be giuen, whether to the Souldior, or Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. I ſay therefore, that man for no other cauſe, of all other Creatures, is onely capable of felicitie, but in that beyond vegetatiue, and ſenſaliue faculties, hee is endued with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, by meane of which, working vertuouſly, he may come to cheefe good, and enioy higheſt delight. In this humane intellect, twoo moſt principall faculties are founde, the one of which is called by the Philoſophers, vnderſtanding ſpeculatiue, whoſe obiect is trueth, the other, practike vnderſtanding, which is conuerſant about that good in humane opperations confiſting. By all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons theſe twoo faculties are placed in humane vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, conſidering that of all things which this vniuerſall frame containeth, ſome bee the workes of the greateſt god and Nature, other be humane opperations: In the works of God and Nature, truth is ſought after, in humane oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, good. By meane of theſe two faculties, man acquireth two ſorts of perfections: one of which is called Habite ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue, the other, Habite practike. Habite ſpeculatiue is no other but a knowledge of all thoſe things, that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende the vniuerſall frame, the which, as they are of three ſorts, ſo be there three ſeuerall ſpeculatiue habites: ſeeing that ſome are by their owne proper eſſence, ſeperate from ſenſible matter, as is the omnipotent and moſt excellent God, the Intelligences aſsiſting the Celeſtiall Spheares, and thoſe, which of the Metaphiſicks themſelues, are called Tranſcendentes, as <hi>Ens,</hi> good, truth, the thing, &amp; ſuch like, the knowledge whereof, is deſeruedly called Wiſedome: ſome again by their eſſence, are wholly drowned in ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible matter, and with motion conioyned, and theſe bee the heauens, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; bodies mixed: the knowledge of theſe things, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led natural Philoſophy. There be yet ſome other, which in effect can neuer be ſeperate from ſenſible matter: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding naturally they are ſuch, as by part imaginatiue, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16643:139"/>with the minde, they may be conſidered, or imagined: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration or imagination of matter, and this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall knowledge, diuided into Geometrie, which handleth continuall quantitie, that is, line, ſuperficies, and body: and arithmetike, beeing conuerſant about diſcreet quantitie, which is number: there bee further ſome ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue habites comprehended vnder theſe three heades, by the Logitians termed, ſciences ſubalternall, or halfe ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for in reſpect of the ſubiect, whereabout they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant, they participate of naturall knowledge, but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the manner, by which they proue their concluſions, they are mathematicall, as thoſe, that embrace mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call concluſions, for their beginning. Amongſt theſe, is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie, conſidering bodies, and motions celeſtial, the like alſo naturall knowledge doing, but in a diuerſe manner: then proſpectiue, which intreateth of viſible line, Stere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie, being employed touching ſolide bodies; &amp; muſicke, reſpecting number harmonicall, with other ſuch like: And theſe be al the ſciences and habites, wherewith intellect ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue is adorned, in inueſtigating, and finding out of truth. Practicke habite, is no other, but the knowledge of all thoſe thinges, whereof man is the beginning: and they be diuided into two heades, actiue, and doing, part actiue, is a firme vnderſtanding of thoſe thinges, which appertaine to the good gouernment of himſelfe, his houſe, and finally of the common weale. The doing or performing habite, is that knowledge, which is called arte: this being diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe mechanical, and liberall. But leauing apart mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall art, as impertinent to a ciuil man, we wil affirme, that amongſt liberall artes, Grammer is numbred, Rhethorike, Dialect, Poeſie, Muſicke, both of voice &amp; inſtrument, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Architecture, and the art of Phiſicke, and amiddeſt all theſe, we wil allot the principalleſt place to art Millitarie, as of al other the moſt excellent, which by the Philoſopher was placed in the number of artes, it hauing belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, all thoſe conditions, which in an art are required, that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16643:140"/>is, materiall ſubiect, end, and the inſtrument, which to the end conduceth, neither wanting there alſo firm beginnings and principles wherewith euery day, great ſouldiers ſerue their turne: materiall ſubiect is battel, victorie the end, and armes the inſtrument: Theſe are all the perfections (moſt famous Queene) which may bring a man to his end, beeing felicitie: of which no doubt, thoſe are the moſt excellent, and worthy of greateſt honor, that more readily may make a man happy. If therefore I ſhall ſhew, that learning and habites ſpeculatiue, haue greater parte in felicitie, than art Militarie, I beleeue the learned ſhall haue wonne the day. If that be true, which all the piudent affirme, that of things created, the ſame exceedeth all others in perfection, which draweth neareſt to diuine bountie, and dooth of it moſt participate: Out of queſtion the man learned, in boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and dign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tie will be ſuperiour to the ſouldier; in that hee learned, is endewed with that vertue, which maketh a man like to things diuine. For ſcience and ſapience which be incident to the learned, by meane of contemplation, make a man companion with God, vniteth him with chiefe good, and true felicitie: The Philoſopher confirmeth the ſame in the tenth of his Ethickes, where hee ſayeth, that thoſe, who buſie their mindes in contemplation, addict themſelues to the ſtudie of good letters, and are, than al others, by God better beloued; becauſe they adorne that parte of the minde, which hath greateſt ſimilitude with things diuine: whereuppon God kindleth the light of his diuine grace in their ſoules, comforting them with high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ioy, and true beatitude: As alſo otherwhere commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Metaphy ſicke, hee ſaith, that though it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, yet notwithſtanding it is worthy of ſupreme honor, as that which raiſeth our vnderſtanding from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, exalting it to the knowledge of high &amp; diuine things: and therefore he worthily affirmeth, that the wiſeman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerneth the ſtarres: as he that far remote from a vulgar life, being of himſelfe ſufficient, liueth moſt happy. <hi>M. Tullius</hi> in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:16643:140"/>firſt of his <hi>Tuſculanes</hi> ſayth, that Philoſophie is a gift giuen by God, and that in this world there can bee nothing more ſweete or excellent: what thing is to be deſired more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent or worthier of a man, then ſapience: this by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the knowledge of al things diume and humane, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth the mind to be ſetled and repleniſhed, with cheefe ioy: if this be not a thing worthie of commendations, what is to be commended? And <hi>Architas Tarentine</hi> ſayth, that wiſedome, amongſt al other things humane, is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and is as ſight among the ſences, vnderſtanding in the ſame ſoule, and as the Sunne amongſt the ſtars, ſacred. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo ſophie procureth not the felieitie of one particular alone, but further, aſsiſteth the happie liuing of an whole Cittie, as diuine <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth in his <hi>Meneſeno,</hi> ſaying: to the Philoſopher, and no other, appertaineth the gouernment of a Cittie: and in the fift of the Common-wealth: Thoſe Cities cannot be happie, where Philoſophers doo not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and the gouernours ſufficiently know Philoſophie: but hee ſaide not, where art Militarie, and excellent warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours gouerne: For the arte of warre hath not onely no parte in felicitie, but rather is contrarie vnto it, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that it deſtroyeth humane generation, and is ſo much the more imperfecter then ſcience, in that the ende of arte Militarie, may bee preuented by fortune, as often times it falleth out, which in ſcience taketh no place: and it is moſt certaine, that where Fortune ſwayeth, vnderſtanding little preuaileth, and where vnderſtanding preuaileth not, there is a manifeſt ſigne of imperfection. Further I alleadge, that by howe much the minde is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the bodie, by ſo much are the actions thereof more excellent then thoſe of the bodie, which beeing true, euen ſo muſt they learned needes be more excellent then Souldiours.</p>
            <p>Conſidering the actions of the learned haue no need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corporall vertue, and thoſe of Souldiours are moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally exerciſed with bodily force; the philoſopher proueth
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16643:141"/>that our mind is diuine, and immortall, in no other reſpect, but becauſe it hath his operations diſtinct from the body: The learneds operations therefore, beeing from the bodie diſioyned, they muſt needs haue in them ſomething diuine, and be truly worthy to be placed amongeſt the things moſt honourable: the which notwithſtanding by Souldiers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be affirmed: whoſe actions beeing wholly intermixed with the body, haue in them that imperfection which the body bringeth to the minde, and all matter to his proper forme. I could produce many other arguments, to ſhew, that Armes euer ought to yeelde to Learning (as good <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> affirmeth) and grant the Laurel garland to the tong and eloquence of the learned, which notwithſtanding for breuitie ſake I paſſe ouer; And onely in our behalfe, I wil ſet downe ſome examples, for manifeſtation, that good let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are of force, to exalt men vp, euen vnto heauen, and to place them amongſt the Gods. <hi>Liſanias</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> as <hi>Leontius</hi> the Greeke declareth, beeing in Sciences moſt profound, went to <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſtirred vp ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in thoſe people then rude and barbarous, as that they made him not their King, but worſhipped him as a god, and hauing dedicated vnto him a Temple, was the firſt that was called <hi>Iupiter, Apis,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Toroneus</hi> and <hi>Niobe:</hi> he paſsing from <hi>Argos</hi> to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by meane of the Sciences, he attained that reputation, as beſides, being made king, he was helde and worſhipped for a god: And ſo great was the reuerence towards him, as that by publike Edict there was a capitall puniſhment ſette downe againſt whomſoeuer ſhould be ſo hardy as to call him a mortall man. <hi>Belus,</hi> who as <hi>Paulus Oroſius</hi> declareth, ſeigniorized in the vttermoſt confines of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for being an Inuenter and teacher of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall doctrine, was iudged ſo worthy, as vnto whome there ſhould be built a Temple in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Belus. Hermes</hi> ſonne to <hi>Phylo,</hi> a meane man of <hi>Arcadia</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina</hi> his owne daughter, to auoyde the infamie of his inceſtuous originall going into
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16643:141"/>
               <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and being in the ſciences profound, but eſpecially in Geometry, Arithmeticke &amp; Aſtrology, was held for a God, being called the ſonne of heauen, and day, as he that deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from heauen, in the daye light came to bee noted and known. I (moſt illuſtrous lady) with theſe few &amp; ſimple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, authorities, &amp; examples, haue endeuoured to confirme our cauſe: which of it ſelfe is ſo firme, and ſecure, as there is no need of Rhetorical arte, for ſuſtentation of it. I aſſure my ſelfe, Signior <hi>Brancaccio</hi> in his own conſcience wel knowes, that he defendeth an vniuſt quarrell: although like an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Knight, hee entreth nowe the fielde, not to looſe his honor. I can be wel content, Signior <hi>Patritio</hi> (ſaid <hi>Brancaccio</hi>) that you may confirme the poſſeſsion of honour: ſeeing that can not be loſt, which hitherto is not poſſeſſed. It is now long ſince (aunſwered <hi>Patritio</hi>) that reaſon ſtoode to the arbitrement of Armes, againſt whoſe violence learned men could make no reſiſtance: but now brought to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of Iuſtice, I hope the matter wil otherwiſe ſucceed: and that at laſt the learned ſhall be eſtabliſhed intheir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place and dignitie.</p>
            <p>Then the Queene: It is hie time you vſe your armes, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Brancaccio,</hi> for otherwiſe I perceiue you in very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger. The affection which your Highneſſe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly beareth towards ſouldiers, (ſayde <hi>Brancaccio</hi>) is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an occaſion of your feare, than any eminent daunger: for if that be true, which the other daye Signior <hi>Gualinguo</hi> ſhewed, that honour is the reward of vertuous actions, and ſigne of beneficence, the learned ſhall not onely, not haue precedence of the Souldier, but further in honor haue little or no intereſt at all: Conſidering honour to ſcience impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: and to Art Militarie it properly belongeth, in that from Arte Militarie thoſe actions proceede, whereof honor is a reward, and from the learned there proceedeth no exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior action, wherby he may be iudged worthy of honor. But behold another reaſon, Signior <hi>Patritio,</hi> grounded vppon the words of your owne Philoſopher, in the firſt of his Ethikes,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16643:142"/>where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring publike with priuat good, he ſaid: that is to be beloued which is profitable to one alone, but much more diuine &amp; excellent is that which benefiteth nations, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but this being trueth, beholde what a good Logitian I am: Arte Military is a perfection which doth not help one alone, but is a furtherance to Nations and Citties: whereas ſcience profiteth none but the poſſeſſor of it: Therefore Arte Militarie is more excellent and honourable than Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>That it is ſuch an helpe and furtherance, it is a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manifeſt, in that by his Arte, Nations and Citties are defended from rauenous and inſolent ennemies, libertie is preſerued, and religion protected: this cauſeth obſeruance of the Lawes, without which the Common wealth would be, as a body without a ſoule. Wherefore it was wiſely ſet downe in the Proeme of Inſtitutions, that imperiall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ought, not onely to bee garniſhed with Lawes, but alſo with Armes to be adorned. Conſidering that (as the Ciuilians doe affirme) right and equitie ſmally preuaile in a Cittie, and if the ſworde procure not obſeruaunce ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Aulus Cluentius Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> doth affirme, that warriours are the defenders and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Iuſtice: And the Philoſopher referreth one of the principalleſt partes of a common wealth, to Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours: As alſo <hi>Paulus Oroſius</hi> writeth; the ſelfeſame bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Philoſopher in his Politickes confirmed, that the firſt Common wealth amongſt the Graecians ordained, conſiſted of none other than warriours. In like manner great <hi>Lycurgus</hi> knowing, that to a common wealth there was not a more excellent or more profitable thing than this moſt noble Arte, directed all his Lawes which hee gaue vnto the Spartaines, to the perfection and greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Arte Millitarie: through which Lawes, the Spartaines becomming moſt excellent warriors, they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; maintained, not only their owne libertie, but further,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16643:142"/>all Greece, from the innumerable armie of <hi>Xerxes:</hi> that vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetſall good is to be preferred, before the felicitie of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and Arte Militarie before ſcience: <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> plainely ſheweth in the firſt of his Offices, ſaying in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: who is he ſo curious to vnderſtand the nature of things, that a danger hanging ouer the head of his countrie, will not ſodainely leaue contemplation, though he thought to meaſure the greatnes of the world, or number all the ſtarres, and runne to ſuccour? We may and ought therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that art Militarie as an vniuerſall good, ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede ſcience, being but good particular, and conſequently Souldiours, the learned: but aboue all others, before them, which are called Philoſophers, and wiſe men, who not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with matters terreine, like the Giants, endeuour to aſcende vppe into heauen, and make themſelues equall with God, as alſo nouriſhed in idleneſſe, and knowing themſelues vnapt to action: attaining to Magiſtracie, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, ſwelling vppe themſelues in pride, they retire from ciuil companie into a ſolitarie life: and after hauing beene mewed vp to theyr ſtudies and Bookes, they become leane and macerate, and not able to determine in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Sunne heateth, wholly confounded, they waſte themſelues in melancholie humours. But leauing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and comming to the excellencie of Arte Militarie, it is truely an heape of all thoſe perfections, which make a man heroycal in an eminent degree: and beginning from the vertue of fortitude, this is moſt proper to Art Military, and is no leſſe from it inſeperable, then light from the Sunne.</p>
            <p>By this vertue <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> was woorthie of eternall praiſe, who alone vpon the bridge oppoſed himſelfe to the power of al <hi>Tuskane,</hi> for the ſafety of his countrey. And no leſſe worthie of honour was <hi>Leonidas Spartane,</hi> who fighting for his country, yea, &amp; for the libertie of al the Greeks, with three hundred valiant ſouldiers, ſuſtained at <hi>Thyrmopylis,</hi> for
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16643:143"/>the ſpace of three daies, the force of <hi>Xerxes</hi> armie. Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as the preſeruer of prudence, is neceſſary to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this arte: In that he can hardly ſubdue his enemie, which hath not firſt an habite in conquering himſelfe: The act of temperaunce towards the faire women of <hi>Daryus,</hi> was no leſſe glory vnto Alexander, then were the two victories obtained, by valor, and fortitude: by this vertue, <hi>Scipio Affricane,</hi> brought principall glorie to himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite to his country, who in <hi>Spaine,</hi> beeing a young man of foure and twenty yeeres of age, and without a wife, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored vnto her husband, a moſt beautifull and noble yong woman, returning vnto him for her dowrie, the money of her raunſome: and by this moſt vertuous action hee tamed the ſierce courage of the <hi>Celtyberians,</hi> which peraduenture by fortitude he had neuer ſubdued. Finally, the <hi>Romans,</hi> as we reade, triumphed ouer the whole world, no leſſe by being temperate, than valiant. The vertue of liberality is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary, in warrelike Arte: for by this the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Captaine, alluring the mindes of his ſouldiours, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them prone to battel, and obtaining of victory. By this vertue, great <hi>Alexander,</hi> drew the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx</hi> into the vttermoſt parts of the Eaſt, throgh whoſe valor he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed ouer <hi>Aſia.</hi> By this <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> ſubdued, not only the barbarous nations, but alſo drew vnto himſelfe the minds of his own ſouldiers, to ſpoile themſelues and their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of liberty, to make him lord and monarch: and certainly liberty may be ſaid to haue bin only proper to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence alſo is no ſmal ornament to this our Arte, ſeeing the magnificent captaine, by this, not onely with his owne men, but alſo amongſt ſtrangers, acquireth reputation &amp; glorie. <hi>Octauian</hi> euer coueting to exceed <hi>Mark Antony</hi> in thoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, the one and other preſented to the people, as in all actions of magnificence, ſo in battels was he euer againſt the ſelfe ſame man victorious: and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> rather by this, than any other vertue, obtained honours in his owne countrey, and abroad: magnanimitie is no leſſe an adiunct of milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16643:143"/>profeſsion, then is whitnes of ſnowe: for that warrior who hath not a loftie and magnanimous minde, ſhall neuer accompliſh glorious enterpriſes: <hi>Caeſar</hi> was of ſo great a minde, as paſsing by a little obſcure village, hee ſaide vnto a ſouldier that diſcommended the place; vnderſtand thou, O friend, that I would rather chooſe to be cheefe in this place, then ſecond in <hi>Rome:</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> for this vertue, ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the great, was of ſo haughtie a minde, as hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſome, that there were diuers worlds, ſighing, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lamented, that being now ſeauen and twentie yeares of age, he had not yet conquered nor gotten one. As vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory and ambition, obſcure the actions of this ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, ſo doth the vertue of modeſtie, cauſe it to bee wonderfull reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: the good <hi>African</hi> acquired no leſſe glory in refuſing with modeſtie, the ſuperfluous honors offered vnto him, by the Senate, and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> then he did in vanquiſhing and ſubduing the proud forces of the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> As on the contrary, <hi>Alexander</hi> obſcured his famous acts, by the vice of ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he accepting, by ſycopha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to be called the ſonne of <hi>Inpiter Hammon,</hi> and finally, with all thoſe honors, to bee honored, which rather agreed with the ſupernall gods, then any mortall man. Clemencie alſo moderatrix of anger, is in a manner neceſſarie to the managing of this arte, in that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is an obfuſcation to the vertues of the minde, and impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth bodyly force, and vigor: wherefore an angry Captain forgetting his arte, and ſtratageme, eaſily becommeth a prey to his enemie: <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as he was, and euer ſhall bee the warrior of the world without peere, ſo of al others was hee moſt curteous and gentle; neither can wee finde, that bee fought at any time with his enemie being in furie: and by being much more ready to pardon, then reuenge, he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned finally betrayed, and ſlaine. Whereas on the contrary, <hi>Alexander</hi> by the vice of anger, obſcured his great victories, for in fury he deliuered <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> to the Lion, pearced the breaſt of <hi>Clito</hi> with a launce, and put <hi>Caliſtheues</hi> to death. Affabilitie, and curteſie, though to the ſeueritie of this art,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16643:144"/>they ſceme litle befitting and conuenient: yet are they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, as the thinges that procure a Captain to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and beloued of his ſouldiers, by this vertue <hi>Scipio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican</hi> obtained great honor, and profit: for he was ſo affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and domeſticall amongſt his ſouldiers, that although he had an exceeding great armie, yet ſaluted hee them all by their names. As vertue cannot be practiſed without iuſtice, ſo alſo without iuſtice cannot arte militarie conſiſt: by this the valorous Captaine procureth himſelfe to be beloued for hope of iuſt reward, as alſo to be feared through expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deſerued puniſhment: And not onley moral vertues, but ſome liberall artes alſo ſeeme neceſſary to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this arte: and amongſt others Rhethoricke produceth moſt admirable effects, which the leſſer <hi>Scipio</hi> manifeſted in <hi>Spaine,</hi> who finding his armie very licentious, &amp; corrupted altogether with depraued cuſtomes, by a moſt eloquent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, without any other meanes, reduced them to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine diſcipline: and <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> by this arte of ſpeaking, confirmed his Souldiers mindes in <hi>France,</hi> aſtoniſhed with the hugenes of the duch mens bodies, and therefore he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a moſt glorious victorie againſt proud <hi>Ariouiſtus:</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the ancient Captaines ſo eſteemed, as alſo thoſe of theſe daies, holde the force of cloquence to bee ſo great in arte militarie, that ſeldome or neuer, they enter into battail; but firſt they confirme the mindes of the Souldiers, by a Martiall Oration, enflaming them vnto battaile. And being of moſt notable importance, and a ſingular precept of arte militarie, to preſerue an armie healthfull, I will alſo affirme, that to haue knowledge in ſome thinges, which appertaine to the arte of Phiſicke, cannot but be a ſpeciall aſsiſtance: for it ſhall wonderfully import a skilful Captaine, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the quality of the aire, the goodnes of waters, &amp; wines, the properties of meates: as well in chooſing out ſituation for his encamping, as for the nouriſhment of his armie: &amp; we may read, that Romane Captaines contended no leſſe in this, then in other martiall practiſes. Architecture further
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16643:144"/>is neceſſary to this arte, eſpecially that parte, which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to fortification, for wanting this knowledge, a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine can neither defend, offend, nor expugne a citie. In this point <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſo excellent, as that of himſelfe he brought admiration to the world, through the towers, brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, fortreſſes, and engines, whereof euen yet to this daye, there appere diuers monumentes, and repreſentations. In my opinion (moſt illuſtrous lady) I haue manifeſtly enough declared, that this our noble arte, is a conſent, &amp; harmony, of al the worthieſt perfections, and an heape of all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: being an arte truly worthy of thoſe men, who for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating of deuinitie, and mortalitie, are termed <hi>Heroes:</hi> wherefore no meruaile though <hi>Curtius,</hi> moſt valiant of any other Romane Knight, was by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued worthy to fill vp that huge gulffe, in the market place of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the moſt excellent and pretious thing which in that citie could be found, neither can it bee alleadged, but that there were alſo at the ſame inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in <hi>Rome,</hi> men in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning moſt excellent, <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> &amp; <hi>Numa</hi> hauing there pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their golden philoſophie. I could further by infinit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples make demonſtration, that militarie arte, is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfections, apteſt to exalte a man, euen to the higheſt degree of glory, but all volumes and writings being heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with repleniſhed, I refer my ſelfe ouer to that which the hiſtoriographers affirme. Notwithſtanding to open the eies of the learned, I will affirme, that amongſt the ancientes, armes were euer in greater eſtimation, then letters, which may be conceiued by the ſtatues, &amp; images, framed of their cheefeſt gods, and painted, not with books, or ſcroules of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in their hand, but with inſtruments of warlike arte, they minding to manifeſt, that without armes, there could bee no perfect deitie: they gaue therefore vnto <hi>Ioue</hi> lightning, to <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Pluto,</hi> a tridental mace, to <hi>Saturne,</hi> a ſickle, or ſithe, to <hi>Apolle,</hi> a bowe, arrowes, and a darte, to <hi>Hercules,</hi> a clubbe, to <hi>Pallas</hi> a ſhielde, a lance, and helmet, to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> a bowe, ſhafttes, and a darte, vnto <hi>Cupide</hi> a bowe,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:16643:145"/>and fatall arrowes. And further, the ancients eſteemed this art of ſo great excellence, as that it could not continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the protection of ſome particular deity. And therefore they eſteemed <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Bellona,</hi> gods of war, adorning their Statues with warlike inſtruments, which inſtruments, they alſo thought worthy to be made by diuine hand and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and therfore they beleeued <hi>Vuicane</hi> to be the Gods armourer, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſheweth, ſaying,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulcane at his hot worke, doth ſweate and blow,</l>
                  <l>To make the piercing ſhaft for Ioue his bow.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the holy ſcripture calleth the great God, the god of Armies, &amp; not of the learned: ſo that Signior <hi>Patritio,</hi> you may yeeld your ſelfe vanquiſhed, and not put your ſoule to compromiſe, for you well know, that you defend an vniuſt cauſe. <hi>Patritio</hi> laughed, &amp; ſaid: You Signior <hi>Brancaccio</hi> ſhew your ſelfe ingrate, yea, and trecherous towards the learned, ſeeing the Armes, and art of ſpeaking, from the learned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, you vſe againſt themſelues. And I am out of al doubt, that if you were not as great a ſcholler, as a ſouldiour, you could neuer in this conflict, haue ſhewed your ſelfe ſo aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous a Champion: and yet for al this, the victorie ſhal not remaine on your ſide, though you haue lightly wounded mee, for with more mortall blowes I haue pierced you. I vnderſtande you (ſayde <hi>Brancaccio</hi>) you would inferre, that your arguments remaine yet firme and vnſhaken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I haue not yet made any anſwer: and by commending Armes, that I haue not a iotte obſcured the glory of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Therefore from that I haue alleadged, it may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that your firſt foundation goeth to ground: for honour is not a reward of perfection, which procureth the felicitie of him alone that poſſeſſeth it, but is a reward of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that helpeth others: and that it may appeare, howe your reaſons conclude not againſt Souldiours, I will ſette downe the difference, which your Philoſopher maketh betweene prayſe and honour, touched the other day by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualier Gualinguo.</hi> Prayſe (ſaith hee) is that ſpeech, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16643:145"/>ſingularitie of vertue, and is proper to habite, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon wee vſually commend <hi>Praxiteles</hi> and <hi>Phydias</hi> for the habite of ſculpture which they had in excellencie: but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour agreeth not properly to habites, but vertuous oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, For it is the true reward of excellent action, in that if one had vertue, and ſhould bee idle, hee might rather bee prayſed, then honoured. Nowe vertuous opperations beeing in two kindes, ſome internall, as to contemplate, and others externall, as to practiſe armes: it is a thing manifeſt, that honour cannot belong to internall opperation, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall action, being knowne to none but to him onely that worketh, it cannot ſtirre vp any to honor it: It muſt needs therefore bee the reward of externall action, which beeing manifeſt, not only to the worker, but alſo to others, moueth, and vrgeth the honourer, who knoweth it, to giue honour thereunto: And therefore the Philoſopher ſaith well, that honour rather conſiſteth in him honouring, then in him honoured, minding to make knowne, that to attaine to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable action, it is neceſſarie that the action bee knowne for vertuous by the honourer. The actions therefore of men learned, Signior <hi>Patritio,</hi> as your ſelfe haue concluded, being actions intrinſecall, and only of the minde, as by you learned only they are known and vnderſtood, ſo you by your ſelues may inwardly honor them, but theſe not manifeſt to others, you ſhall rather bee worthie of praiſe then honour: And on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, the opperations of vs Martialiſts, grounding their internal beginning in the mind, and diſcouering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the eyes and eares of others by meane of valor and vertue of our bodies, as well of prayſe, as likewiſe of higheſt honour, wee are thought worthie: neither can fortune bee an impediment of our glorie, although ſometimes ſhee hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der victorie: For art Militarie, as diuers others alſo, hauing two endes, the proper ende thereof is victorie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Haniball</hi> obſcured not a whit his warlike honor, by the laſt battaile hee loſt in <hi>Affricke,</hi> hee (according to <hi>Scipioes</hi> iudgement) not hauing failed to performe all that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:16643:146"/>to a moſt expert warriour for the obtaining of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: neyther vnto you Signior <hi>Patritio,</hi> will it be any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, to haue beene ſubdued by me this day in combate: for though you haue not perſwaded, yet notwithſtanding haue you ſpoken in all excellencie touching perſwaſion. Signior <hi>Patritio</hi> further alleaged, that arte Military had no parte in felicitie, and much leſſe in honor, ſeeing it is a conſumer of humane kinde: and in this hee is deceiued, hauing beene by vs declared, that it is a good which vniuerſally aſsiſteth nations, and citties, by procuring vnto them obſeruation of lawes, and defending them from ennemies: and therefore <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> ſaith well: that of neceſſitie warre muſt bee made, to liue in peace. Your Philoſopher alſo commendeth the making of war, vndertaking it for defence of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, &amp; to procure ſafetie to them, with whom we haue war. This is conformable alſo to the holy ſcripture, where wee reade that God permitteth, yea and commanndeth war, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Hebrew people, Arme you, and confound theſe Philiſtines, enemies to the people of God: and in <hi>Ieremy</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we may obſerue, that God ſaid, Prepare your ſhields and helmets, put on your breaſtplates, ride your horſes, and take vp your lances againſt your enemies, gathering your ſelues all together to bartaile, and accurſed be he who ſhal not ſhed bloud againſt the enemies of the people of Iſrael. And in the <hi>Machabees</hi> we reade, that God euer moued and ſtirred vp the people to battaile againſt the enimies of Iſrael: And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalmes writeth, Bleſſed bee the Lord, who inſtructeth our handes to battaile. And in all the Bookes of the Kings, wee finde, that God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded battaile for the chaſticement of rebelles, ouerthrowing of tyrantes, and for the occaſion of peace in the worlde. Wherefore it would be both a lawful and commodious war, if chriſtian princes did arme their people againſt the cruell ſword of the Eaſt, and enemies of the elect and choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, endeuoring to abate the pride of ſo outragious a tirant, and by force of armes to reduce thoſe nations to better life,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16643:146"/>&amp; worſhip diuine, then as they now liue with all ſauage cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes. And although it cannot be done without effuſion of humane bloud, and ſome acte of iniuſtice, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, of it no reckoning were to bee made, ſeeing without fire and ſword, ſuch a Phiſition could not heale the like impoſtume. And not to paſſe ouer any thing whereof our aduerſarie boaſteth, I ſay, that <hi>Lyſanias, Belus, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, Apis,</hi> and other ſuch, were deified, not ſo much for the knowledge wherwith they were adorned, as throgh the action of beneficence. For as theſe opperations may by euerie one bee comprehended and conceiued, ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall actions, eſpecially to luskiſh and ſtupide people, being concealed and hidden, they cannot bee honoured. And this is a thing ſo manifeſt, as it booteth not herein to make any other or further replication. Signior <hi>Brancaccio</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus argued, it ſeemed to the Queene and all the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, that the victorie remained on the Knights parte: when Signior <hi>Renato Cati</hi> ſtanding vp on his feete: Bee it lawful for mee (ſayd he) moſt famous Queene, to defend our cauſe, ſeeing Signior <hi>Patritio</hi> (rather a partialiſt, then faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Champion of al the learned, contemning the preualent armes of Ciuilians, hath onely drawne out againſt him the weak tempred ſword of contemplatiue Philoſophie, &amp; yet hee infallibly knoweth, that theſe ſort of learned, though worthie of praiſe and commendations, yet neuertheleſſe are they poore, naked, and contemptible. This indeede we ſee euerie day (ſaide <hi>Patritio</hi>) for no other cauſe, but becauſe the fooliſh multitude is intentiue on baſe gaine, and diſcerneth not the vertue and demerite of honour. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Ciuilians, (thriſe excellent Queene (ſaid <hi>Brancac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> ſmiling) to confound the lawes, wherefore no maruaile though Signior <hi>Cati,</hi> a moſt famous Ciuilian, hath broken the Law of combate by Champion, &amp; ſodainly as a warriour freſh in breath, commeth to aſſaile, iudging that I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie wearie, and ſore wounded: but he is deceiued, for I wante neyther voyce, tongue, nor woordes, to aunſwere,

            <p>It is proper to Ciuilians (ſaid <hi>Cati</hi>) to reforme the lawes, reducing extreame ſeueritie to termes of equitie, for vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rigor and ſeueritie, is no other but extreame iniurie: and it might worthily be thought an iniury, if wee without audience or any attention, ſhould looſe our action for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans defect: Be it therefore lawfull for mee to defend the right and prerogatiue of Ciuilians, and to giue the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant to vnderſtand, that by great oddes wee ought to haue precedence of Souldiers. And becauſe Signiour <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caccio</hi> groundeth his intention vpon the definition of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is the reward of beneficence, not ſwaruing one iote from it, but to ouerthrowe this argument with his owne armes, I meane thus to argue: whether is of greater moment to humane kinde, Armes, or Letters: It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that Lawes by the great God were produced together with the world: an infallible Law mooueth and gouerneth the heauens: And firme and iuſt lawe, tempereth the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contradiction of elementes, ſeeing whatſoeuer in one parte, the one vſurpeth of an other, in ſome other reſpect at the ſame inſtant it reſtoreth and recompenceth: To the inuiolable lawe of Nature, plants giue place, and creatures obey. Finally, lawes deſcended from Heauen, rule this inhumane globe. Armes not from heauen (although the Poets fabling, and Painters faining adorne therewith the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the gods) but from the profound centre of the deeps, by ſome moſt malignant ſpirit brought to light, ſo far off are they from helping and benefiting the world, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they waſte and teare the Image of God, conſume the workes of nature, and ouerthrow humane inuentions. He that ſhould take armes out of the worlde, ſo ſhoulde hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue iniuries and oppreſsions. For not remaining anie one, who by force would vſurpe vpon another, all things, by the whole ſome adminiſtration of lawes ſhould be gouerned
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16643:147"/>in peace: And therefore good <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was woont to ſay, that if all were iuſt, there would be no neede of Armes, nor of valour.</p>
            <p>Hee that ſhoulde remooue Lawes out of the worlde, not onely citties woulde remaine as a body without a ſoule, but al things being left to arbitrement, of violent armes, and being none who might preſcribe iuſt and vpright warres, with the maner how with iuſtice to put them in execution, euery thing would goe hand ouer head, and iniuries ſhould neuer haue end, and this would be nothing elſe but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue out of the worlde that felicitie which mortall men in this life may enioy. Here peraduenture Signior <hi>Guilio Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare</hi> will alledge, that without armes, the world ſhould want a great ornament: and that armes (as experience teacheth) are much more apt to make men great and glorious, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinde of learning: as alſo, that ſtatues, crownes, triumphs, and all ſupreame honours, are appropriate to vanquiſhing warriors, and not to Ciuilians or Lawyers, and hee will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vrge, confirming the ſame before he ſpoke, that armes iuſtly vndertaken, are no other but good. But I againſt all this will auerre, that armes are greater trouble, than orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the world, they being the beginning of vſurping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods, and bringing free cities into into llerable ſeruitude, forcing many times wiſe men, to obey the follie of flagitious and cruell tyrants: I affirme that vniuſtly, and through abuſe, they erect ſtatues, giue crownes, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs to conquering Souldiers: For what greater abuſe or thing more inhumane can there be, than to ſeek greatnes and glory, from ſlaughters, deuaſtations, inceſts, ſacrileges, rapines: and finally, to triumph in humane miſeries? I ſay further, that there can no iuſt warre be extended, but that which in defence of our countrey is made: and all other warre, (with the Philoſophers leaue bee it ſpoken) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to lawes of Nature: which, as it permitteth that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may defende themſelues, and recouer their owne, ſo ſuffereth it not, that for deſire of raigning, one ſhoulde v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:16643:148"/>that wherof another is lawfully poſſeſſor: nature not minding, that one ſhould performe to another, what hee would not haue done to himſelfe: but further ſuppoſing, that one might moue warre againſt another, how great be the iniquities, that inſue of that iniuſtice? the innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom it concerneth not to examine, whither the war bee iuſt, or vniuſt, who are inforced to obay their Princes, vnder paine of diſloyaltie, and rebellion, and the greater part of them hauing neuer taken ſword, or weapon in hand againſt enemies, are taken priſoners, hewen in peeces, ſlain, there houſes robbed, wiues violated, and finally, Townes, Caſtles, and Cities put to fire and ſworde, ſo that what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, arte, and humane wiſdome, in many yeares haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, by force of armes, in very ſhort ſpace conmeth to be defaced. Signior <hi>Giulio Caeſar</hi> affirmeth, that vertue little preuaileth in a citie, if there be not thoſe, that may procure the obſeruance thereof: and that vaine is councell in the Senate, if there be none to put it in execution: as alſo that armed Knights, be the miniſters of iuſtice: and in all this, as he ſaith well, ſo vnawares, he ſecretly confirmeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence of honor, to the Ciuilians, if peraduenture hee doe not minde to holde a paradox: that they who execute, are more worthy of honor, then thoſe that commaund. Wiſe Ciuillians, firſt iudge, whether the warre bee iuſt, or vniuſt, neither moueth the Captaine, or the armie without his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and commiſsion, commaund him: and therefore the diuine Philoſopher ſairh, that the ſcience, which debateth of warre, ſhould ſway and rule ouer the other, which exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes it, minding to inferre, that the Ciuillians ſhould, not onely haue precedence, but furder, euen command ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: And the Philoſopher himſelfe was of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſubiecting arte militarie, to imperiall arte, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſcience. Our aduerſarie ſeeketh to preuaile by an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion confirmed of the Philoſopher, that the vniuerſall muſt bee preferred before the particular: which beeing true, armes out of doubt, will giue place to the lawes; for
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16643:148"/>the lawes without any detriment, bring vniuerſall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the whole worlde. and armes, though they helpe, ſo is it but onely one people, and one Prince alone, whom they further: and yet cannot they effect this, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicing of many. I would faine finde out a Prince, who by his ſouldiers helpe, had euer performed ſuch a benefit to the worlde, as did the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> by the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers asſiſtance, in ordaining of lawes: this queſtion eſſe, was an vniuerſall benefit, whereof the whole world might haue vſe, through infinite ages: but if honour bee meaſured from beneficence, ſo much more worthy of honor was <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> then <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by howe much hee without detriment, did good vnto all: And <hi>Caeſar</hi> by winning foure and fiftie bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, benefiting only the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and rather his ownr ſelfe, cauſed the death of many hundred thouſandes of menne, and defaced an infinite number of Citties and Caſtles. Signior <hi>Brancaccio</hi> further in fauour of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers alleadgeth, the authoritie of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the diuine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſo pher who placeth warriors amonſt the principalleſt members in his common wealth. Touching <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> I referre my ſelfe ouer to that which the Philoſopher affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in his Politickes, ſeeing hee by moſt effectuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſheweth that the lawes of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> &amp; comonwealth of the Spartanes, is in the number, of diſhoneſt, &amp; euill ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealths: As for <hi>Plato,</hi> he in his ſecond, and fourth bookes of his commonwealth, ſetting downe the duetie of Souldiers, ſpeaketh thus: Wee haue placed in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Souldiers as dogges, who to the principall Cittizens are to obay, as to Paſtors of citties: and there is no doubt, but by principall Cittizens, thoſe are intended, who admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter equitie, and iuſtice, as the Lawyers doo, and to noble and geneious dogges, this diuine Writer reſembleth the ſouldiers, ſaying, that like good dogges, they ſhould be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant to obſerue the enemies, ready to proſecute and follow them, and hauing ouertaken, valiant to ſet vppon them. Out of this place of <hi>Plato,</hi> may be gathered conformable to my
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16643:149"/>opinion, that all other warre is vniuſt, but that which in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our countrie is vndertaken: ſeeing hee ordaineth ſouldiers for no other end, but to garde the citie, and he that of them maketh other imployment, abuſeth them: and our mortall enemy <hi>Cato,</hi> animating vnto the vertue of fortirude, ſaith: fight in defence of thy countrie: and not to acquire another mans dominion and empire. As therefore it cannot be denied (moſt famous Lady) but that armes are for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the lawes, and vnto them ſubiect, ſo muſt wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſouldiers are farre inferior to profeſſors of the lawes, conſidering that in a cittie, the one be as pleaders, &amp; Rhethoritians, the other as porters, and guardians: and this vnto me ſeemeth ſo manifeſt a thing, as that it cannot bee contradicted. But becauſe I perceiue by the geſtures &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his perſon, that our obſtinate aduerſary, long ſince, impatient of attention, is moſt defirous to ſpeake, I will here pawſe, aſſuring my ſelfe, that he, conſidering he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth neither voice, tong, nor wordes, wil neuer giue place to manifeſt reaſon: but confident in his eloquence, he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to retort, the vpright and ſincere iudgement, of our moſt gratious Queene. Eloquence preuaileth greatly in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers (ſaide <hi>Brancaccio</hi>) and ſo far, that many times it hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the good conſcience of a ſincere &amp; equal Iudge: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I doubting, to the end that the entire &amp; impartial indge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of our illuſtrous moderatrix, may remaine vnſpotted, and immaculate; I will make it knowne, that Signior <hi>Cati,</hi> hath done like that incircumſpect Greek, who to terrifie the Troians, putting off his own, armed himſelf with the armes of fearce <hi>Achilles.</hi> Notwithſtanding, before I laye open his ſophiſtications, it is neceſſary, that ſomewhat more amply difcourſing, of that which to a warrior appertaineth, I play the Philoſopher ſearcheth out the ſecrets of Nature, and infallible prouidence of God: it cannot be denied moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lady, but that Nature is vnto man a ſcepmother, and to the other creatures a moſt kinde and tender mother, for ſhe hath not onely made them ſtrong of body, but with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16643:149"/>garments ſo couered, and naturall armes ſo fortified them, wherewith moſt fierce, they proudely go forward, without fearing offence: and ſuch creatures as ſhee hath produced them, weake and vnarmed, ſo hath ſhee prouided them ſwift feete, or light feathers and wings, to the ende, that flying or running away, they might withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from danger. Man ſhould haue been naked, vnarmed, and of al other creatures weakeſt, and expoſed to all kinde of iniurie, if by fingular grace of the heauens there had not beene granted vnto him, the excellent gift of the minde, and light of reaſon: the which, what Nature hath denied him, it doth doubly ſuppeditate. This at one inſtant ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with armes, and armed him with lawes, to the ende, that by armes, hee might ſecurely walke amongſt the moſt cruell beaſts, and by lawes leade a perfect &amp; ciuill life. It is therefore to affirme, that lawes deſcend from heauen: and armes were drawnefrom the deepe, for both the one and the other were woorkes of reaſon and equitie; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, were both celeſtiall inuentions. And as it is true, that laws without armes cannot conſiſt, ſo is that falſe which the aduerſarie affirmeth, that to take armes out of the world, were a bringing in of that felicitie, which moſt of all in this mortal life is deſired: for without armes, the lawes would not onely bee vaine and friuolous, but a man, botne to rule ouer Creatures, beeing weake and vnarmed, ſhoulde bee a prey to more terrible beaſtes; neither ſhould they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them haue any greater defence, then haue the little Pigmeans againſt the Cranes. But admit wee grant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice to truth, that Lawes are more noble then Armes, yet for all this cannot Signior <hi>Cati</hi> conclude, that the Ciuilians Doctrine is of greater eſteeme then Arte Millitarie, nor that Generals of Armies are to giue place to Doctours of the Lawes. For if ſuch a prerogatiue ſhould bee graunted, it muſt not concurre with the Ciuilians or Lawyers, but with the Law giuers, conſidering that thoſe who eſtabliſh Lawes, be great Princes, or commonwealths
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:16643:150"/>moſt prudent men, or for ſome heroycall vertue moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as were <hi>Draco</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> who gaue Lawes to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Lacedemonians Lawgiuer, <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Pompylius</hi> that preſcribed lawes to the Romaines. <hi>Faleus</hi> to the Carthaginians, <hi>Mercurius Treſmygiſtus</hi> to the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Zoroastres</hi> to the Perſians, and Bactrians, <hi>Minos</hi> to the Cretans, <hi>Charondas</hi> to thoſe of Tyre, <hi>Zalmoſi</hi> to the Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, <hi>Hippodamus</hi> to the Mileſians, <hi>Plato</hi> to the Cicilians, and other ſuch like: But to dilate alittle touching that doctrine, whereof the Ciuilians do ſo inſult, as Signior <hi>Patritio</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring vp the Sciences, and Artes liberall, hath not placed it in his Catalogue, ſo thinke I it a thing very difficult, to find any place for it amongſt habites ſpeculatiue &amp; actiue. Among the Sciences it cannot be recounted. For Science beeing nothing elſe, but to vnderſtand the thing by his proper and infallible cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Ciuilian demaunded of that he knoweth, can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge no other cauſe, but that the Lawes ſay ſo, or Doctors thus affirme: It cannot alſo properly be termed an Art, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept after the ſame manner as <hi>Petrarch</hi> calleth it, that is, an Arte of ſelling words and lies: For though ſhe be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about the Lawes, as the proper argument of her doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, yet can ſhe not alter nor transforme them into diuers formes, as other Artes doe their matter and ſubiect: For Lawes by the Ciuilians cannot be tranſinuted, but by great Princes and Lawgiuers: which the Lawyers obſeruing, and not knowing with what other title to honour this their ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, haue tearmed it knowledge of equitie, or <hi>iuris pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia,</hi> which ſignifieth no other, but that wiſe dome which is conuerſant in adminiſtring equitie and iuſtice, according as the Lawes commaund. Nay but I will further affirme, that this their facultie cannot likewiſe be aumbred amongſt the morall vertues: For the Philoſopher diſcuſsing of that particular vertue called Iuſtice, ſaieth, that it is conuerſant about iuſtice diſtributrue and commutatiue, that is, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing rewarde and puniſhments, and reducing contractes
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:16643:150"/>and permutations to equallitie. And this vertue beeing well conſidered in her foundation, is not proper to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, but vnto Law-giuers: For the Lawyer or Cruilian is about three things conuerſant: To interprete the written lawes, To aunſweare according to Lawe, And to iudge aunſwerable to the Lawes, or according vnto thoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, which by inueteration are of like force and vigour as the Lawes. Out of this wee may drawe a concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Philoſopher, that the written Lawe, is a ſilent Lawe: And the Lawyer is no other, but the liuely or ſpeaking Law: and ſo conſequently, that the vertue of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice dependeth not on him, but on the Lawgiuer and Law.</p>
            <p>The Philoſopher affirmeth, that there be three condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or qualities of men: ſome diſtruſting authoritie, yeeld onely to reaſon: Others not Very capable of reaſon, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt ſatisfied in authoritie: And a third ſort, who inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reaſon, do likewiſe contemne the authoritie of the wiſe; and as theſe laſt, of all other be the worſt, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond giue proof but of a dul conceit, ſo the firſt note a moſt eminent and pregnant wit, and ſuch are the Philoſophers ſpeculatiue, who ſeeke after trueth, and not authoritie. And the Captains in war be thoſe, who deſpiſing other mens au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, are gouerned only by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; among the ſecond ſort, lawyers are recounted, whoſe doctrine is wholy grounded vpon authoritie, &amp; therfore they were wont to ſay, that one is not worthy to be heard, that ſpeaketh without authority; and out of this a maxime may be gathered, that Lawyers of themſelues know nothing, but that their knowledge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vppon other mens opinions, ſo that many times when they woulde anſwere, or determine, wythout ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any eye to the force of reaſon, where there is no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Lawe, they fall a reciting their opinions, who haue ſcribled a number of Booke caſes, and for the moſt part, tie themſelues thereunto, as to a moſt certaine and infallible rule. And the confuſion of theſe Doctourſhippes is ſo great, who haue written rather for gayne and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:16643:151"/>then through any zeale of iuſtice, as that often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, they pleade not what is moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and iuſt, but what is moſt vſuall and common: a thing ſurely worthy of diuiſion, and alſo compaſsion, as though the opinion of ten ignorant were more to be eſteemed, then the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of foure wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whether theſe ſort of learned (moſt renowmed Lady) ſhoulde precede warriours, who with notified valour adorne their countries, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Troupes, adminiſter argument to writets, to immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize themſelues, and conſecrate vnto memorie martiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and magnanimous attempts, it is eaſie to iudge. By that which hath beene ſpoken, it is clearely manifeſt, that Signior <hi>Cati</hi> ſetteth foorth lawes with the perſon of the Lawgiuers, vnto whome they bring princes and men heroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, it ſhall not bee greatly inconuenient, that armed men giue place, ſeeing theſe determine and command the wars, as alſo determine the place of Generals in an armie, and not Ciuilians, as hee conſtantly affirmeth, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture hee meane, that it is all one to commaunde ouer Souldiours, as ouer executions, or the miniſter of iuſtice, this being a proper office of ciuilians. This truth may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the deſcription the philoſopher maketh of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent &amp; wel ordained commonwealth, wherin he diuideth the Citizens into foure orders, that is, Warriours, Senators, iudges, &amp; prieſtes, and deſcribing their offices, he calleth not the ſouldiers by this brutiſh terrne of dogs, but maintainers, defenders, and miniſters of iuſt warres: and to the Senator, hee allotieth adminiſtration and gouernment of things pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: And theſe men it concerneth to determine of warre or peace, &amp; to theſe ſouldiours giue place, for in ſuch a degree they are to be reputed as Lords &amp; princes. And to Iudges, who are no other then ciuilians or lawyers, belongeth the office of determining and deciding controuerſie. The prieſts who are the ancienteſt, reduced as it wer to their laſt &amp; moſt perfect end, he aſsigneth the care of things holy. And wee muſt obſerue, that althogh to frame a city of it ſelf ſufficient,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:16643:151"/>there be many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions of men required, notwithſtanding, to faſhion a commonwealth, the philoſophers minde is, that theſe foure orders ſhould ſuffice: and hee altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thoſe mechanical degrees, which practiſe ſordide, &amp; baſe profeſsions, as thoſe, who of vertue are incapable, the rather being inſtrumentes, then parte of a cittie. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore authoritie grounded on effectuall reaſon, bee worthy of credit, it cannot bee true, that ciuilians in a cittie, are as Rhethoritians, neither that their office is to command ouer Warriors, although their authoritie ſtretcheth to command ouer ſergeantes and executioners: for they ſit to iudge and determine controuerſies, &amp; not to gouern publike affaires: yet is this no impediment, but that a Lawier may haue place in the Senate, &amp; be in the number of Rhethoritians, when he ſhal not only vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that which <hi>Vlpian</hi> teacheth, but ſhal further poſſeſſe a part of thoſe ſingular vertues, wherewith Signior <hi>Cati</hi> is adorned, and al theſe moſt excellent Ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, out of doubt moſt worthy councellors, of our thriſe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrous Prince. Seeing vnto theſe the name of Lawgiuers, rather agreeth, then ciuilians or Lawyers: Signior <hi>Cati</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferreth, that of lawes, &amp; lawyers the benefit is much more vniuerſall, then that of armes, and ſouldiers: ſeeing Lawes aſsiſt the whole world, and armes benefit but one ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or a Prince alone: and that the benefit of the lawes, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without other detriment: but armes cannot pleaſure without others offence: we haue ſufficiently declared, that armes vniuerſally are beneficial, if they be moued &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with iuſtice, &amp; that God him ſelf, by his owne mouth commandeth warres: as alſo that iuſt victorie is no leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the vanquiſhed tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> victors: For they vanquiſhed, are by it reduced to a better life, for if armes were wicked, becauſe of offending others, the like ſhould the lawes bee, which cannot bee executed without bloud: The lawes commaund that menquellers bee ſlaine, quarrellers, and wounders, to bee recompenced with the like meaſure, that theeues, adulterers, ſacrilegious, and finally all malefactors,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:16643:152"/>be bitterly puniſhed: notwithſtanding, becauſe this is done through zeale of iuſtice, and that the good may inioy peace, thoſe laws are good, as alſo the Lawyers, if with iuſtice they execute them: but if they bee vniuſt, they doo more hurte then wicked ſouldiours, for ſouldiers preſerue their friends, and by all euill meanes offende their enemies, whereas coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and auaricious Lawyers, by giuing hope of ſafetie to their friendes, haue no other drift or intention, but to gnaw them euen to the bones. And to ſpeake truth, of all ſortes of men, the vniuſt Lawyer is moſt pernitious. I could alleadge (moſt illuſtrons Ladie) many other reaſons, to manifeſt, that Lawyers, though they bee woorthie of honour, yet are they not therefore to be preferred before ſouldiers: but becauſe I ſee my ſhip now approaching neere her port, paſsing ouer to cuſtome &amp; common vſe, I affirme thus much, that Dukes, Kings, and Emperours themſelues, are called Knights, but neuer Doctors: and armed in Iuſts, Turneyes, and alſo in the middeſt of the fielde, in Battaile they ſhewe themſelues amongſt warriours, but in aſſemblies and Courts of Ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Lawyers, or other learned, they neuer preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for diſputation ſake: and this for no other cauſe, but in that the exerciſe of armes is proper to great and mightie men, and more honourable then that of Letters. Do we not further ſee, that in ſolemnities and ceremonies, where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence is ſpecially regarded, that great Captaines and men of warre, go nearer the perſon of the king or Emperor, then Secretaries, Chancellors, or Councellors, although they bee great Doctors, and maruailous learned men: this beeing a manifeſt ſigne, that of the ſame Kings or Emperours, Armes are farre more highly eſteemed then Letters, and Souldiers then Doctours. But if nothing els ſufficed, the iudgement of women euer infallible, might ſerue for certaine proofe, that warriours are more to bee eſteemed then Doctours, we ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the greater parte of women are rather carried away with the loue of knights, then men learned, neither can the ioy be imagined, which they feele in their hearts, when they
